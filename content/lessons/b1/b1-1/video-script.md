### Opening (0:00 - 0:30)
**[Instructor greeting with enthusiasm]**

"Gamarjoba! Welcome to B1 level - congratulations on reaching this milestone! You've mastered the alphabet, basic grammar, and simple sentences. Now we're entering the fascinating world of Georgian verbs. Today, we're going to explore what makes Georgian verbs truly special: polypersonal agreement. This concept will change how you understand Georgian grammar forever!"

### Introduction (0:30 - 5:00)
**[Show comparison: English vs Georgian sentence structure]**

"In English, when we say 'I love you,' we have three separate words. In Georgian, this becomes just two words: მე შენ მიყვარხარ [me shen mikhvar'khar]. But here's the amazing part - that verb, მიყვარხარ, already contains information about who loves whom!

Let me show you:
- მე [me] - I (the subject)
- შენ [shen] - you (the object)
- მიყვარხარ [mikhvar'khar] - I love you (the verb containing 'I' and 'you')

Georgian verbs are called 'polypersonal' because they simultaneously mark the subject AND the object in a single verb form. This is revolutionary compared to languages like English, Spanish, or French.

**[Display visual comparison]**

English: I + see + you = three separate words
Georgian: ვხედავ [vkhedav] = I see you (all in one verb!)

This polypersonal system is one of Georgian's most distinctive features. By the end of this lesson, you'll understand how it works!"

### Main Content Section 1: Understanding Polypersonal Agreement (5:00 - 20:00)
**[Display verb structure diagram]**

"Let's break down a polypersonal verb. Take the verb 'to see' - ხედვა [khedva].

In the first person singular, we say ვხედავ [vkhedav], which means 'I see.'

Can you spot the 'I' part? It's the prefix ვ- [v-] at the beginning! This is the subject marker for first person singular.

Now let's look at the structure:
- **ვ-** [v-] = I (subject marker)
- **-ხედავ** [-khedav] = see (verb root + ending)

When we add an object, it changes! Look at 'I see you':
- ვხედავ **შენ** [vkhedav shen] = 'I see you'

But look at 'I see him/her':
- ვხედავ **ღმერთი** [vkhedav ghmert'i] = 'I see God' or 'I see him'

And notice: ვ-**მ**ხედავ [v-m-khedav] - I see him/her. See that **მ-** in the middle? That's the object marker for third person!

**[Display comprehensive chart]**

Let me show you the full picture. Georgian verbs contain:

1. **Version vowel** (optional prefix like ი-, უ-, ა-, ე-)
2. **Object prefix** (marks who receives the action: მ-, ვ-, გ-, etc.)
3. **Root** (the verb core)
4. **Subject suffix** (marks who does the action: -ვ, -ხარ, -ს, etc.)

That's a lot of information packed into one word!"

**[Clear board and show example breakdowns]**

"Let's practice identifying these parts:

Example 1: ვმუშაობ [vmushaob] - 'I work'
- ვ- = I (subject)
- მუშაობ = work (root + ending)
- No object marker = no specific object

Example 2: გიყვარხარ [gikhvar'khar] - 'I love you' (informal)
- გ- = you (object marker)
- -ყვარხარ = love + I suffix
- Implied subject 'I' in the ending

See how rich these verbs are? They tell us so much in a single word!"

---

### Main Content Section 2: Introduction to Series I (20:00 - 35:00)
**[Display Series I timeframe chart]**

"Georgian verbs are organized into three 'series.' Today, we're focusing on **Series I**, which covers Present and Future tenses.

**[Show timeline]**

Series I: Present & Future
- "I am seeing" (present)
- "I will see" (future)
- "I am working now"
- "I will work tomorrow"

Important: In Georgian, the same verb form can mean BOTH present and future! Context tells us which one.

**[Display examples]**

Example 1:
- მე ვმუშაობ [me vmushaob] = "I am working" OR "I work" OR "I will work"
- დღეს ვმუშაობ [dgh'es vmushaob] = "Today I work" (present)
- ხვალ ვმუშაობ [khval vmushaob] = "Tomorrow I work" (future)

**[Clear and show conjugation]**

Let's look at a full Series I conjugation. We'll use ხედვა [khedva] - "to see":

**Present/Future Tense - ხედვა [khedva] (to see)**

| Person | Georgian | Transliteration | Translation |
|--------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| I see | ვხედავ | vkhedav | I see |
| You see (informal) | ხედავ | khedav | You see |
| He/She/It sees | ხედავს | khedavs | He/She/It sees |
| We see | ვხედავთ | vkhedavt | We see |
| You see (plural/formal) | ხედავთ | khedavt | You see |
| They see | ხედავენ | khedaven | They see |

**[Highlight subject markers]**

Do you see the pattern? 
- First person: ვ- [v-] prefix
- Third person: -ს [-s] suffix
- Plural: -თ [-t] or -ენ [-en] ending

Let's pronounce these together:
- ვხედავ [vkhedav]
- ხედავ [khedav]
- ხედავს [khedavs]
- ვხედავთ [vkhedavt]
- ხედავთ [khedavt]
- ხედავენ [khedaven]

**[Practice pronunciation]**

### Main Content Section 3: Introduction to Verb Classes (35:00 - 48:00)
**[Display verb class chart]**

"Georgian verbs are divided into four classes based on their grammatical behavior. Understanding these classes will help you predict how verbs conjugate!

**Class I: Transitive Verbs** (most common)
- These verbs take a direct object
- Examples: ხედვა [khedva] (see), წერა [ts'era] (write), კითხვა [k'ithva] (read)
- Structure: Subject + Object + Verb
- Example: მე წიგნს ვკითხულობ [me ts'igns vk'ithulob] - "I read the book"

**Class II: Intransitive Verbs**
- These verbs don't take a direct object
- Examples: მუშაობა [mushaoba] (work), მოგზაურობა [mogzaur'oba] (travel)
- Structure: Subject + Verb
- Example: მე ვმუშაობ [me vmushaoba] - "I work"

**Class III: Medial Verbs**
- These have characteristics of both transitive and intransitive
- Examples: ბრძანება [brdz'neba] (sit), დგომა [dgoma] (stand)
- More complex conjugation patterns

**Class IV: Indirect Verbs**
- These involve emotions, perceptions, or indirect actions
- Examples: ყველას [khvelas] (love), სურს [surs] (want), უბრალოებს [ubraloebs] (understand)
- Special case marking required

**[Show Class I example in detail]**

"For now, we'll focus on Class I verbs (transitive) in Series I. These are the most common and most regular.

Take ხედვა [khedva] - to see. This is Class I because you always see SOMETHING or SOMEONE.

**[Display sentence analysis]**

Sentence: მე შენ ვხედავ [me shen vkhedav] - 'I see you'
- მე [me] = I (can be omitted, implied in verb)
- შენ [shen] = you (object)
- ვხედავ [vkhedav] = I see (ვ- marks subject 'I', root marks 'see')

This is the foundation you need!"

### Practice Exercise 1: Identifying Verb Parts (48:00 - 52:00)
**[Interactive exercise instructions]**

"Now let's practice what we've learned. I'll show you Georgian sentences, and you'll identify the different parts of the verb.

Example 1: ვწერ [vts'er] - 'I write'
- Can you identify the subject marker? ვ- [v-]
- Can you identify the verb root? წერ [ts'er]

Example 2: ის ხედავს [is khedavs] - 'He sees'
- Subject marker? (none - subject pronoun ის)
- Verb ending? -ს [-s] marks third person
- Verb root? ხედავ [khedav]

Example 3: ჩვენ ვხედავთ [ch'ven vkhedavt] - 'We see'
- Subject marker? ვ- [v-] 
- Plural marker? -თ [-t]
- Root? ხედავ [khedav]

Great job! Keep practicing these patterns."

---

### Summary (52:00 - 58:00)
**[Review key concepts]**

"Let's review what we learned today:

1. **Polypersonal verbs** - Georgian verbs contain both subject AND object information in a single word form
2. **Series I** - Covers Present and Future tenses with the same verb form
3. **Subject markers** - Prefixes like ვ- [v-] or suffixes like -ს [-s] mark who does the action
4. **Four verb classes** - Georgian divides verbs into Class I-IV based on their grammatical behavior
5. **Class I (Transitive)** - Verbs that take direct objects, most common pattern

**[Display challenge sentence]**

Here's a challenge for you: Can you analyze this sentence?
- მე ვწერ წიგნს [me vts'er ts'igns] - "I write the book"

What did you identify? Let me help:
- Subject: მე [me] / ვ- [v-] = I
- Verb: ვწერ [vts'er] = I write  
- Object: წიგნს [ts'igns] = the book (in dative case)

**[Encouraging tone]**

You're doing great! This is complex grammar, but you're building strong foundations."

---

### Assignment (58:00 - 60:00)
**[Practice exercises and homework]**

"Before the next lesson, please:

1. **Memorize the Series I conjugation** for ხედვა [khedva] - practice writing it out 5 times
2. **Identify subject markers** - Find 10 Georgian sentences and circle all subject markers you see

4. **Practice pronunciation** - Record yourself saying all six forms of ხედვა [khedva]
5. **Read simple texts** - Find basic Georgian sentences online and identify which verbs are Series I

**[Show practice resources]**

Don't worry if this feels overwhelming - polypersonal verbs are challenging, but also one of Georgian's most beautiful features. Take your time, practice daily, and don't hesitate to review this lesson if you need to.

**[Final encouragement]**

Remember: Every Georgian speaker mastered this system, and so will you! Understanding polypersonal verbs will unlock the entire language for you.
