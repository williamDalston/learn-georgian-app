## Answer Key / Guidelines

**Part 1:**
1. SRS shows you information at optimal intervals (just before forgetting) to maximize retention
2. By showing cards at increasing intervals (day 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.), it strengthens memory each time
3. Cramming doesn't build long-term memory; SRS uses spaced intervals for permanent retention

**Part 3:**
Sample flashcard should include: Georgian script, transliteration, IPA, translation, example, notes

**Part 4:**
Aim for: Morning 10-15 min, Evening 5-10 min, Weekly 30 min

**Part 7:**
Solutions:
1. Set reminder/alarm, integrate into existing routine
2. Link to another daily activity (coffee, breakfast, etc.)
3. Reduce new cards per day, review existing cards more
4. Remember: perfection isn't the goal, consistency is!
