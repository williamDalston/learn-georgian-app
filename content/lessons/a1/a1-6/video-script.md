### Opening (0:00 - 0:30)
**[Instructor greeting]**

"Gamarjoba! Congratulations - you've completed all the foundational pronunciation lessons! You now understand the Georgian alphabet, ejective consonants, difficult sounds, and basic greetings. 

But here's the truth: learning a language isn't just about lessons - it's about consistent daily practice. Today, we're going to set you up for long-term success by teaching you how to use a Spaced Repetition System, or SRS, to build and maintain your vocabulary. This is the tool that will transform your Georgian learning from occasional study to systematic mastery!"

### Introduction: Why SRS Matters (0:30 - 5:00)
**[Show statistics and research]**

"You've probably heard the phrase 'use it or lose it' - and it's absolutely true for vocabulary. Research shows that without reinforcement, we forget 50-80% of new information within 24 hours. That's why cramming doesn't work for language learning.

A Spaced Repetition System solves this problem by showing you words just before you're about to forget them. Here's how it works:

**[Show timeline diagram]**

- Day 1: You learn a new word
- Day 2: System shows it again (you're starting to forget)
- Day 4: Shows it again (memory strengthening)
- Day 8: Shows it again (memory even stronger)
- Eventually: Shows it every few weeks or months (now in long-term memory!)

This is scientifically proven to be the most efficient way to build vocabulary. And the best part? It takes only 10-20 minutes per day once you're set up!"

### Section 1: Choosing Your SRS Tool (5:00 - 10:00)
**[Show comparison of tools]**

"There are several excellent SRS tools available. Let me show you the two best options for Georgian:

**Option 1: Anki (Free, Desktop + Mobile)**

**[Show Anki interface]**

Anki is:
- Free (open-source)
- Available on all platforms
- Highly customizable
- You create your own cards
- Best for serious learners

**Option 2: Memrise (Freemium, Web + Mobile)**

**[Show Memrise interface]**

Memrise is:
- Free with paid options
- Pre-made courses available
- More gamified (fun!)
- Easier for beginners
- Less customizable

**My recommendation:** Start with Anki if you're serious about learning. It gives you complete control and it's free. But if you want something easier to set up, Memrise has great pre-made Georgian courses.

**[Show setup links]**

I'll walk you through setting up Anki since it's what I use and recommend. But the principles apply to any SRS system!"

### Section 2: Setting Up Anki for Georgian (10:00 - 18:00)
**[Step-by-step Anki setup]**

"Let's set up Anki step by step:

**Step 1: Download and Install**

1. Go to ankiweb.net
2. Download Anki (it's free!)
3. Install on your computer
4. Create a free account (syncs across devices)

**Step 2: Create a New Deck**

1. Open Anki
2. Click 'Create Deck'
3. Name it 'Georgian - A1' or 'ქართული A1'
4. You can create subdecks later for different topics

**Step 3: Configure Settings (Important!)**

**[Show settings menu]**

Go to Deck Options:
- **New cards per day:** Start with 10-15 (you can increase later)
- **Maximum reviews:** Set to 999 (unlimited)
- **Easy interval:** 4 days
- **Starting ease:** 250%

These settings ensure you see new words frequently enough to remember them.

**Step 4: Install Georgian Font Support**

Make sure Anki can display Georgian script:
1. Use a font that supports Georgian (like Noto Sans Georgian)
2. Anki will automatically use system fonts
3. Test by typing: გამარჯობა

If you see the letters correctly, you're good!"

### Section 3: Creating Effective Flashcards (18:00 - 25:00)
**[Show flashcard creation]**

"Now for the most important part - creating good flashcards. Bad cards waste your time. Good cards accelerate learning.

**Card Type 1: Basic Recognition (Front → Back)**

**[Show example card]**

Front: გამარჯობა

Back: 
- Transliteration: gamarjoba
- Translation: hello
- IPA: /ɡɑmɑrd͡ʒɔbɑ/
- Audio: [play button]
- Example: გამარჯობა, როგორ ხართ? (Hello, how are you?)

**Card Type 2: Production (English → Georgian)**

**[Show example card]**

Front: hello

Back:
- Georgian: გამარჯობა
- Transliteration: gamarjoba
- IPA: /ɡɑmɑrd͡ʒɔbɑ/

**Best Practices:**

1. **Always include Georgian script** - Don't rely only on transliteration
2. **Include IPA pronunciation** - Especially for difficult sounds
3. **Add audio if possible** - Hearing helps pronunciation
4. **Include example sentences** - Context helps memory
5. **Add notes** - Usage tips, cultural context, grammar notes

**Template I recommend:**

```
Front: [Georgian word]
Back:
  Pronunciation: [IPA]
  Transliteration: [romanized]
  Translation: [English]
  Example: [example sentence]
  Notes: [usage tips]
```

**For pronunciation-focused cards, add:**

```
Front: Listen to pronunciation
[Audio]
Back:
  Word: [Georgian]
  IPA: [IPA]
  Repeat after audio
```

**[Show Anki card creation screen]**

You can customize card templates in Anki - I'll provide a template in the resources!"

### Section 4: Daily Practice Routine (25:00 - 28:00)
**[Show schedule]**

"Here's the daily routine I recommend:

**Morning (10-15 minutes):**
- Open Anki
- Review all due cards
- Learn 5-10 new cards
- Practice pronunciation while reviewing

**Evening (5-10 minutes):**
- Quick review of difficult cards
- Add any new words from the day's lesson
- Practice phonetic drills (ejectives, trilled r, etc.)

**Weekly (30 minutes):**
- Review all words from the week
- Update cards with better examples
- Organize decks by topic

**Key Principle:** Consistency beats intensity. 15 minutes every day is better than 2 hours once a week!"

---

### Section 5: Vocabulary Frequency Lists (28:00 - 29:00)
**[Show frequency list]**

"Don't just learn random words - learn the most useful ones first!

I've provided a frequency list in your resources. Start with:
1. **Top 100 words** - These appear in 50% of all Georgian text
2. **Top 500 words** - These cover 70% of daily conversation
3. **Top 1000 words** - These cover 80% of general text

Prioritize:
- Greetings and basic phrases
- Common verbs
- High-frequency nouns
- Essential adjectives

Focus on words you'll actually use, not obscure vocabulary!"

---

### Summary (29:00 - 29:30)
**[Review key points]**

"Let's review:

1. **SRS is essential** - Spaced repetition is the most efficient way to learn vocabulary
2. **Set up Anki** - Free, powerful, customizable
3. **Create good cards** - Include script, IPA, audio, examples
4. **Daily routine** - 10-20 minutes per day is enough
5. **Use frequency lists** - Learn useful words first

Remember: The system works, but YOU have to use it consistently!"

---

### Assignment (29:30 - 30:00)
**[Show action items]**

"Your homework:

1. **Set up Anki** - Download, install, create your first deck
2. **Create 20 cards** - Use words from lessons A1-1 through A1-5
3. **Practice daily** - Review cards for 10-15 minutes each day this week
4. **Track your progress** - Note how many cards you've mastered

I've included templates and resources in your materials. Use them!

Congratulations on completing A1 Level! You now have the foundation - pronunciation, basic phrases, and a system for building vocabulary. Keep practicing, and you'll be speaking Georgian in no time!

Nakhvamdis! გამარჯობა! Keep up the great work!"
