## Video Script

### Opening (0:00 - 1:00)
**[Instructor greeting with focus on pronunciation]**

"Gamarjoba! Welcome back! In lesson A1-2, we learned about the tripartite distinction between voiced, aspirated, and ejective consonants. Today, we're going to do a deep dive into ejective consonants - one of the most challenging but most distinctive features of Georgian.

This lesson is intensive practice. We're going to work on producing each of the six ejective consonants until they feel natural. Remember: if you don't master these now, pronunciation habits will fossilize, and it will be much harder to correct later. So let's dedicate this full hour to perfecting these sounds!"

### Introduction: Why This Matters (1:00 - 5:00)
**[Show diagram of ejective mechanism]**

"Ejective consonants are produced by closing the glottis - that's your vocal cords - and then using your mouth to build up pressure. When you release the closure, you get that distinctive 'pop' sound.

**[Point to diagram showing glottis closure]**

Here's what happens:
1. Close your glottis (your vocal cords)
2. Build pressure in your mouth cavity
3. Release the closure - POP!

This creates a sound that's completely different from aspirated consonants (which have air) or voiced consonants (which vibrate). 

**[Show comparison chart]**
- თ [tʰ] - Aspirated: air puff
- ტ [tʼ] - Ejective: glottal pop
- დ [d] - Voiced: vibration

These are THREE completely different sounds to Georgian speakers. If you use the wrong one, it can change the meaning of words. Let's master them!"

### Section 1: The Six Ejective Consonants (5:00 - 20:00)
**[Display all six ejectives with IPA symbols]**

"Georgian has exactly six ejective consonants. Let's work through each one systematically:

**1. კ [kʼ] - Ejective K**

**[Demonstrate slowly, then normal speed]**

This is made in the back of your throat. Try this exercise:
- Close your glottis (feel your throat close)
- Position your tongue for 'k'
- Build pressure
- Release with a POP

**[Practice words]**
- კაცი [kʼatsi] - 'man'
- კაბა [kʼaba] - 'dress'
- კარგი [kʼargi] - 'good'

**2. პ [pʼ] - Ejective P**

**[Demonstrate with hand gesture]**

Made with your lips. Practice:
- Close glottis
- Press lips together
- Build pressure
- POP!

**[Practice words]**
- პაპა [pʼapʼa] - 'grandfather'
- პატარა [pʼatʼara] - 'small'
- პასუხი [pʼasukʰi] - 'answer'

**3. ტ [tʼ] - Ejective T**

**[Demonstrate]**

Made with your tongue against your alveolar ridge (roof of mouth). Practice:
- Close glottis
- Tongue tip to alveolar ridge
- Build pressure
- POP!

**[Practice words]**
- ტბა [tʼba] - 'lake'
- ტყე [tʼqʼe] - 'forest'
- ტექსტი [tʼekʰstʼi] - 'text'

**4. წ [tsʼ] - Ejective TS**

**[Demonstrate]**

This is an affricate - a combination of 't' and 's' with ejective quality. Practice:
- Close glottis
- Position for 'ts' sound
- Build pressure
- POP!

**[Practice words]**
- წყალი [tsʼqʼali] - 'water'
- წიგნი [tsʼigni] - 'book'
- წითელი [tsʼitʰeli] - 'red'

**5. ჭ [tʃʼ] - Ejective CH**

**[Demonstrate]**

Another affricate - 'ch' sound with ejective quality. Practice:
- Close glottis
- Position for 'ch' sound
- Build pressure
- POP!

**[Practice words]**
- ჭა [tʃʼa] - 'well'
- ჭაიჭამ [tʃʼaitʃʼam] - 'I ate'
- ჭურჭელი [tʃʼurtʃʼeli] - 'dishes'

**6. ყ [qʼ] - Ejective Q (Back Velar)**

**[Demonstrate with emphasis on back position]**

This is the most challenging! Made way back in your throat, almost at your uvula. Practice:
- Close glottis
- Position your tongue very far back
- Build pressure
- Strong POP!

**[Practice words]**
- ყვავილი [qʼvavili] - 'flower'
- ყველა [qʼvela] - 'all'
- ყველაზე [qʼvelaze] - 'most'"

### Practice Exercise 1: Isolated Ejectives (20:00 - 30:00)
**[Guided repetition practice]**

"Now let's practice each ejective in isolation. Follow along with me:

**[Slow repetition, one by one]**
- კ [kʼ] - კ - კ - კ
- პ [pʼ] - პ - პ - პ
- ტ [tʼ] - ტ - ტ - ტ
- წ [tsʼ] - წ - წ - წ
- ჭ [tʃʼ] - ჭ - ჭ - ჭ
- ყ [qʼ] - ყ - ყ - ყ

**[Repeat 3 times, increasing speed]**

Now, try to feel the glottal closure. Put your hand on your throat and try:
- თ [tʰ] - feel the air (aspirated)
- ტ [tʼ] - feel the pop (ejective)

Do you feel the difference? The ejective should feel like a sharp release in your throat."

---

### Practice Exercise 2: Minimal Pairs (30:00 - 40:00)
**[Show word pairs on screen]**

"Let's practice with minimal pairs - words that differ only in one sound:

**K-series:**
- ქალაქი [kʰalakʰi] - 'city' (aspirated)
- კაცი [kʼatsi] - 'man' (ejective)

Say them back-to-back: ქალაქი - კაცი
Feel the difference? ქ has air, კ has pop.

**P-series:**
- ფული [pʰuli] - 'money' (aspirated)
- პაპა [pʼapʼa] - 'grandfather' (ejective)

Say: ფული - პაპა
Feel the air vs. pop?

**T-series:**
- თხა [tʰxa] - 'goat' (aspirated)
- ტბა [tʼba] - 'lake' (ejective)

Say: თხა - ტბა
This is the clearest distinction!"

---

### Practice Exercise 3: Word Positions (40:00 - 50:00)
**[Demonstrate ejectives in different positions]**

"Ejectives can appear anywhere in a word. Let's practice:

**Word-initial (beginning):**
- კაცი [kʼatsi] - man
- პაპა [pʼapʼa] - grandfather
- ტბა [tʼba] - lake

**Word-medial (middle):**
- ბეკა [bekʼa] - name Bek'a
- საპა [sapʼa] - soap
- კატა [kʼatʼa] - cat

**Word-final (end):**
- ბაკ [bakʼ] - horn
- საპ [sapʼ] - stable
- ტაკ [tʼakʼ] - crown

**[Practice each position with all six ejectives]**"

### Common Challenges and Solutions (50:00 - 55:00)
**[Show troubleshooting guide]**

"Common mistakes and how to fix them:

**Problem 1: Can't feel the glottal closure**
**Solution:** Try coughing gently - that's your glottis closing! Now try to control it more gently for ejectives.

**Problem 2: Ejectives sound like aspirated**
**Solution:** Focus on CLOSING the glottis, not releasing air. The pop should feel sharp, not airy.

**Problem 3: Can't produce ყ [qʼ]**
**Solution:** This is the hardest! Practice with your tongue far back. Imagine saying 'k' but from the very back of your throat.

**Problem 4: Words with multiple ejectives are hard**
**Solution:** Start slow! წყალი [tsʼqʼali] has TWO ejectives. Practice each separately, then combine: წ...ყ... წყალი"

### Summary (55:00 - 58:00)
**[Review key points]**

"Let's review what we learned today:

1. **All six ejectives:** კ, პ, ტ, წ, ჭ, ყ
2. **Mechanism:** Glottal closure → build pressure → POP
3. **Key distinction:** Ejectives have POP, aspirated have AIR
4. **Practice positions:** Initial, medial, final
5. **Muscle memory:** Keep practicing until it feels natural!

Remember: Master these now, or they'll fossilize incorrectly later!"

### Assignment (58:00 - 60:00)
**[Show practice plan]**

"Your homework before the next lesson:

1. **Daily practice:** 10 minutes per day practicing all six ejectives
2. **Minimal pairs:** Practice თხა vs ტბა, ქალაქი vs კაცი
3. **Word practice:** Use the vocabulary list to practice words with ejectives
4. **Recording:** Record yourself and listen back - can you hear the pop?

Use the exercises and worksheet provided. The more you practice now, the easier it gets!

Nakhvamdis! See you in the next lesson!"
