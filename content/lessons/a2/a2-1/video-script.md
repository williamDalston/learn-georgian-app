### Opening (0:00 - 0:30)
"Gamarjoba! Welcome to A2 level! You've mastered the alphabet and basic phrases. Now we're entering the exciting world of Georgian grammar. Today, we'll explore noun cases - this is where Georgian gets really interesting and different from English!"

---

### Introduction (0:30 - 3:00)
**[Show comparison: English vs Georgian sentence structure]**

"In English, word order tells us who does what: 'The cat sees the dog.' But in Georgian, we change the endings of nouns to show their role in the sentence. This is called 'case marking.'

Georgian has 7 cases total, but today we'll master the 3 most fundamental ones:
1. Nominative - the subject (who does the action)
2. Dative - the object (who receives the action)  
3. Genitive - possession (who owns what)

Also important: Georgian has NO grammatical gender. Unlike Spanish (el/la) or French (le/la), Georgian doesn't assign gender to nouns. This actually makes things easier!"

### Main Content Section 1: Nominative Case (3:00 - 15:00)

**What is Nominative?**

"The Nominative case is the dictionary form of the word. This is how you'll find nouns in dictionaries, and it's used for the subject of the sentence.

**[Show example]**
კატა ხედავს - 'kat'a khedavs' - 'The cat sees'

Here, კატა [kat'a] (cat) is in Nominative case - it's the subject doing the action.

**[Show more examples]**
- ბავშვი თამაშობს [bavshvi tamashobs] - The child plays
- მასწავლებელი კითხულობს [masts'avlebeli kit'khulobs] - The teacher reads

In all these examples, the first word (subject) is in Nominative case.

**Key Point:** Nominative is the base form - no special ending needed!"

---

### Main Content Section 2: Dative Case (15:00 - 30:00)

**What is Dative?**

"Dative case marks the direct object (what receives the action) and indirect object (to whom/for whom).

In Georgian, Dative typically ends in -ს [s].

**[Show transformation]**
- Nominative: კატა [kat'a] - cat
- Dative: კატას [kat'as] - (to) the cat

**[Show sentence examples]**
მე ვხედავ კატას [me vkhedav kat'as] - I see the cat
- 'I' (მე) is subject (Nominative)
- 'cat' (კატას) is object (Dative with -ს ending)

**[Show indirect object examples]**
მე ვაძლევ ბავშვს წიგნს [me vadzlev bavshvs ts'igns] - I give the child a book
- 'child' (ბავშვს) - indirect object (Dative)
- 'book' (წიგნს) - direct object (Dative)

**[Show common Dative endings]**
- If word ends in consonant: add -ს
- If word ends in vowel: usually add -ს

**[Practice exercises]**

**[Show transformation practice]**
Nominative → Dative:
- ბავშვი [bavshvi] → ბავშვს [bavshvs]
- წიგნი [ts'igni] → წიგნს [ts'igns]"

---

### Main Content Section 3: Genitive Case (30:00 - 42:00)

**What is Genitive?**

"Genitive case shows possession - 'of' or belonging to someone/something.

In Georgian, Genitive typically ends in -ის [is] or -ს [s].

**[Show transformation]**
- Nominative: ბავშვი [bavshvi] - child
- Genitive: ბავშვის [bavshvis] - of the child / child's

**[Show sentence examples]**
ეს არის ბავშვის წიგნი [es aris bavshvis ts'igni] - This is the child's book
- 'child's' (ბავშვის) - Genitive showing possession

**[Show more examples]**
- სახლის კედელი [sakhlis k'edeli] - the wall of the house
- მასწავლებლის მაგიდა [masts'avleblis magida] - the teacher's desk

**[Show common Genitive patterns]**
- Most nouns: add -ის
- Some nouns: add -ს

**[Practice exercises]**

**[Show transformation practice]**
Nominative → Genitive:
- წიგნი [ts'igni] → წიგნის [ts'ignis]
- სახლი [sakhli] → სახლის [sakhlis]"

---

### Practice Exercise: Case Identification (42:00 - 48:00)
**[Interactive exercise]**

"Let's identify cases! Look at this sentence:
ბავშვი კითხულობს წიგნს [bavshvi kit'khulobs ts'igns] - The child reads the book

- ბავშვი [bavshvi] - what case? Nominative (subject)
- წიგნს [ts'igns] - what case? Dative (object)

**[More practice sentences]**

**[Show multiple examples for practice]**"

### Summary (48:00 - 50:00)
"Let's review the three cases:

1. **Nominative** - Dictionary form, used for subjects
   - Example: კატა [kat'a] - cat

2. **Dative** - Used for direct and indirect objects, typically ends in -ს
   - Example: კატას [kat'as] - (to) the cat

3. **Genitive** - Shows possession, typically ends in -ის
   - Example: კატის [kat'is] - of the cat / cat's

Remember: Georgian has no grammatical gender, which simplifies things!

In the next lesson, we'll learn about pluralization and how cases work with plurals."

---

### Assignment (50:00)
"Before next lesson:
1. Practice transforming nouns from Nominative to Dative to Genitive
2. Write 5 sentences using each case
3. Identify cases in simple Georgian sentences
4. Review the case endings (-ს for Dative, -ის for Genitive)

See you next time! Nakhvamdis!"
