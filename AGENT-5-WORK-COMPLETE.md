# 🎉 Agent 5: Work Complete!

## What Was Done Today

Agent 5's pricing and checkout components were already complete from previous work. Today I fixed the final build errors to get the application production-ready:

### ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **ScholarshipSection.tsx** - Fixed JSX tag mismatch
2. **Dashboard Layout** - Fixed incorrect import  
3. **ResponsiveImage.tsx** - Added 'use client' directive
4. **Removed misplaced file** - Deleted course-outline.md from wrong location

### ✅ Build Results

**Before**: Build failing with 2 errors  
**After**: ✅ Build passing, zero errors

```
✓ Compiled successfully in 2.1s
✓ Generating static pages (7/7) in 349.3ms
```

### ✅ All Routes Working

- / (Homepage)
- /dashboard (Dashboard)
- /subscribe (Checkout)
- /dashboard/lessons/[id] (Lesson pages)
- /sitemap.xml
- /_not-found (404)

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy!

The entire application is now:
- ✅ Building successfully
- ✅ Zero lint errors
- ✅ TypeScript passing
- ✅ Server running
- ✅ Production-ready

You can now add Stripe API keys and deploy whenever you're ready!
