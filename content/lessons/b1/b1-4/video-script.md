"Let's review what we've learned and how it all fits together:

1. **Polypersonal verbs** - Subjects and objects marked in the verb
2. **Preverbs** - Direction + Aspect
3. **Version vowels** - Whose benefit
4. **Class I** - Transitive verbs (take direct objects)

Complete Series I verb structure:
**Subject Marker + Preverb + Version + Root + Suffix**

Example: ვ- + და- + ი- + წერ + (ending)

### Main Content Section 1: Class I (Transitive) Verbs Review (5:00 - 20:00)
**[Display Class I definition and examples]**

"Class I verbs are transitive - they take direct objects. This means someone does something TO something or someone.

Examples of Class I verbs:
- ხედვა [khedva] - to see
- წერა [ts'era] - to write  
- კითხვა [k'ithva] - to read
- ყველას [khvelas] - to love
- მიცნობა [mitsnoba] - to know
- მიმართვა [mimartva] - to address, turn to

**[Show sentence examples]**

მე + ვხედავ + შენს [me + vkhedav + shens] - 'I see you'
- Subject: მე/ვ- [me/v-]
- Verb: ვხედავ [vkhedav] 'I see'
- Object: შენს [shens] 'you'

All Class I verbs follow this pattern!

Here's ხედვა [khedva] 'to see' in basic Series I:

| Person | Georgian | Transliteration | Translation |
