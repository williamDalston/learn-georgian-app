            { "id": "a", "text": "A system that shows you words just before you forget them, optimizing memory retention" },

          "correctAnswer": "a",
          "explanation": "An SRS is a system that uses algorithms to show you information at optimal intervals - right before you're about to forget it. This maximizes memory retention and efficiency."

          "correctAnswer": "a",
          "explanation": "Research shows we forget 50-80% of new information within 24 hours. SRS shows you words just before you forget them, strengthening memory each time. Cramming doesn't work for long-term retention."

          "explanation": "Start with 10-15 new cards per day. This prevents overload while building a sustainable habit. You can increase this number later as you become more comfortable with the system."

          "explanation": "The top 100 words in Georgian appear in 50% of all text. The top 500 cover 70% of daily conversation. Learning these first maximizes your communication ability quickly. You can always add specialized vocabulary later."

          "correctAnswer": "a",
          "explanation": "Consistency beats intensity. 15 minutes daily is far more effective than long sessions once a week because SRS works best with regular reinforcement. Daily practice prevents forgetting and builds strong memories."

          "correctAnswer": "a",
          "explanation": "Missing a day is normal - don't let perfect be the enemy of good! Just continue your routine the next day. The SRS system will show you cards that are due, and you'll catch up naturally. Consistency over time matters more than perfection."
