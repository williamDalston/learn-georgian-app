Expert Curriculum Blueprint: Achieving Conversational Fluency in Georgian (A1–C1)This report outlines a rigorous, academically informed curriculum designed to guide English speakers from a beginner level (A1) to full operational proficiency (C1) in the Georgian language. Given Georgian’s status as a Kartvelian language—structurally isolated from Indo-European languages—the curriculum emphasizes phased mastery of its complex phonology, agglutinative morphology, and highly intricate verbal system, adhering to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) standards.1Executive Summary: Accelerated Path to C1 FluencyThis curriculum is structured for intensive learning, targeting C1 operational fluency within 800–1000 hours of focused study (approx. 12–24 months at 10–15 hours/week). The spiral progression model ensures core concepts are revisited and consolidated at higher complexity levels, aligning with optimal cognitive load management.LevelFocusEst.

Use the A1 Phonetic Table (Section 1.2) to guide articulation.Active SRS Setup: Download and begin using an SRS (Anki/Memrise) with a Georgian Alphabet deck and a 500-word frequency list. Consistency is key.3Daily Ejective Drills: Practice the ejective consonants (კ, პ, ტ, წ, ჭ, ყ) daily using native audio (Forvo) or video (Ling App/YouTube) for at least 15 minutes to avoid fossilizing incorrect sounds.Acquire Core Materials: Secure the foundational textbook (Biliki or Beginner's Georgian) and find a tutor (italki/Preply) for immediate pronunciation check-ins.Learn Greetings: Master basic survival phrases and formal address (Batono/Kalbatono) immediately.Glossary of Key Linguistic TermsTermDefinitionScreeveA category within the Georgian verbal system determined by tense, aspect, and mood (e.g., Present, Aorist, Perfect). Screeves dictate case alignment.PolypersonalismA feature where the verb agrees simultaneously with the subject, direct object, and indirect object within a single word form.Split-ErgativityA system where grammatical alignment (how cases are assigned) changes based on the verb's tense (e.g., Nominative-Accusative in the Present, Ergative-Absolutive in the Aorist).Version VowelA prefixed vowel (e.g., i- or u-) that changes the semantic focus of the verb, often marking subjective (for oneself) or objective (for a third party) action.AoristThe tense/screeve used for the simple past (equivalent to 'I wrote'), requiring the Ergative case for transitive subjects.Section 1: Foundational Linguistic Analysis and Script Acquisition (A1 Framework)1.1. Georgian's Structural Divergence and CEFR AlignmentGeorgian presents a significant structural challenge for English speakers due to its distinct linguistic heritage.2 While many European languages share common grammatical features, Georgian operates with a unique combination of agglutination, complex case systems, and polypersonal verb conjugation, requiring the learner to fundamentally redefine their expectations of grammar. The A1 level is defined as "elementary, the so-called basic knowledge".1 At this stage, the primary focus is not merely on survival phrases but on establishing an immutable foundation in the script and phonetics, paving the way for the later acquisition of morphology. Initial SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) sentence structure is used to introduce simple concepts.41.2. Mkhedruli Script and Phonological Deep DiveImmediate and accurate acquisition of the 33-letter Mkhedruli alphabet is non-negotiable, as delays in script mastery hinder later morphological recognition. A helpful simplification is that the script features no difference between uppercase and lowercase letters.5 The introduction of the alphabet must be paired immediately with precise International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) guidance 6, preventing the adoption of inaccurate, English-based phonetic approximations that would prove detrimental at higher proficiency levels.The most crucial investment at the A1 level must be dedicated to mastering the tripartite system of stop consonants, a feature largely absent in English.6 Georgian stop consonants distinguish between three types: Voiced, Aspirated, and Ejective.TypeIPA Ex.MkhedruliEng. Approx.Drill PhraseVoiced/b/ბbatბაღი (garden)Aspirated/tʰ/თtop (puff of air)თხა (goat) [7]Ejective/kʼ/კk! (trapped air pop)კაცი (man) 8Troubleshooting Ejectives:Failure to internalize the distinction between aspirated and ejective consonants early often leads to permanent fossilization of inaccurate pronunciation habits. Since Georgian morphology is characterized by high density and specificity, the inability to differentiate between ejectives (ტ /tʼ/) and aspirated stops (თ /tʰ/) will impede a student’s ability to recognize or produce distinctions in complex verbal stems and affixes. Thus, a disproportionate amount of A1 instruction (approximately 20% of the initial module) must be allocated to intensive auditory and articulatory training.Tip: If you struggle to hear or produce the ejective sound after 20 hours, try feeling your throat when you say the sound. The vocal cords should be tightly closed (glottal closure), followed by a distinct "pop." Use native clips on Forvo.com or Ling App for side-by-side comparison, or ask your online tutor for 1:1 correction immediately.Other difficult sounds requiring focused practice include the alveolar trilled 'r' (რ), which is executed as a rolled 'r' akin to the Spanish roja 8, and the guttural fricatives ღ /ɣ/ and ხ /x/ (approximating the sound heard in the Scottish loch 6). Learners must also be gradually prepared for the complex consonant clusters common in Georgian, such as წყ in წყალი (water) 8, by first ensuring the phonetic purity of the individual components.Section 2: Mastering Noun Morphology and Basic Sentence Construction (A2 Framework)The A2 level shifts the focus from auditory and written foundations to core syntax, noun declension, and the postpositional system.2.1. A2 Survival Vocabulary, SVO, and Initial CultureThe curriculum must prioritize the acquisition of high-frequency vocabulary (using resources like the Swadesh list equivalent 9) and basic conversational phrases, including greetings (gamarjoba) and expressions of gratitude (didi madloba).10 The Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern is introduced as a typical, structurally familiar model for English speakers, despite Georgian’s flexible word order.4A2 Cultural Integration: Formal AddressCultural learning begins at A2. Learners must use the formal address system—Batono (Sir) or Kalbatono (Madam) immediately following the first name, title, or surname—to demonstrate basic social respect in this hierarchical culture. Only close friends and family typically use first names alone.12 Mastering this distinction (formal vs. informal register) is a mandatory A2 milestone.2.2. Comprehensive Case System IntroductionGeorgian offers a simplification: the complete lack of grammatical gender distinctions (no "he," "she," or "it" forms).13 This is offset by the complexity of the seven noun cases.The cases must be introduced in phases: Nominative (dictionary form, subject of Series I verbs), Dative (direct object of Series I verbs, indirect objects), and Genitive (possession).13 Pluralization is achieved by inserting the suffix -eb between the noun root and the required case suffix (e.g., k'ats + -eb + -i $\rightarrow$ men).152.3. Postpositions Governing CasesA significant structural difference is Georgian’s reliance on postpositions rather than prepositions (like 'on' or 'for').5The critical grammatical principle at A2 is that the specific postposition selected irrevocably determines the case that the preceding noun must take.5Visual Flowchart: Noun $\rightarrow$ Case $\rightarrow$ Postposition LinkageThe instructional material should include a flowchart showing that a noun, before receiving a postposition, must be inflected into a specific case.English ExampleGeorgian Noun PhraseBreakdownGoverning RuleFor the bookწიგნისთვის (ts'ignis-tvis)წიგნ-ი-s-თვისThe postposition -tvis (for) requires the Genitive case.[16]In the houseსახლში (sakhl-shi)სახლ-i-შიThe postposition -shi (in) requires the Dative case, often dropping the Dative suffix -s.[16]From the placeადგილიდან (adgili-dan)ადგილი-t-დანThe postposition -dan (from) requires the Instrumental case, often dropping the Instrumental suffix -t.[16]Common Mistake: English speakers often attempt to apply the Nominative case (the dictionary form) before every postposition. The primary A2 goal is to drill these specific, mandatory case-postposition pairings.Section 3: The Intermediate Verb System: Series I and Infinitesimal Complexity (B1 Framework)The B1 level introduces the core challenge of Georgian: its highly agglutinative, polypersonal verb morphology. Initial focus is placed on the Present and Future tenses, which fall under Series I (Present Series).173.1. Structure of the Polypersonal VerbGeorgian verbs are defined as polypersonal because they agree simultaneously with up to three participants—the subject, the direct object, and the indirect object—within a single word form.18The instructional approach must systematically break down the typical verb structure: Preverb – Person Marker – Version Vowel – Root – Thematic Suffix – Plural Marker.193.2. Preverbs: Directionality and Perfective AspectPreverbs are prefixes affixed to the front of the verb and are crucial for verb meaning and conjugation, though they are absent in Series I imperfective tenses (Present and Imperfect).20Their dual functions are:Directionality: Indicating the direction of motion relative to the speaker (e.g., მი- away from the speaker; მო- towards the speaker; გა- outwards; შე- inwards).20Perfective Aspect: The introduction of a preverb transforms an imperfective verb stem (Present) into a perfective stem, necessary for forming the Future tense (Series I) and the Aorist (Series II).203.3. Version Vowels: Subjective, Objective, and LocativeThe version marker is a prefixed vowel that sits directly before the verb root and is critical for indicating to whom the action is directed.18The two main functional versions are:The Subjective Version (ი-): Signals that the action is performed "for oneself" (reflexive/benefactive). Example: v-i-ts'er means "I write it (for myself)".18The Objective Version (უ-): Indicates the action is directed toward a third party (indirect object). Example: v-u-ts'er means "I write it to him/her" (objective version).18The mastery of these version markers is essential, allowing Georgian to express complex three-participant actions (e.g., "I wrote it to them") using a single, compact verb word (davuts'ere), which requires five words in English.183.4. Verb Class I (Transitive) and Series I ConjugationB1 focuses on Class I (transitive) verbs within Series I (Present Series). In this initial series, Georgian employs a Nominative-Accusative alignment: the Subject is in the Nominative case, and the Direct Object is in the Dative case.Sample Dialogue (B1): Ordering at a RestaurantB1 learners should be able to handle extended, present/future conversations:Learner: მინდა ხაჭაპური და ყავა. (mind-a khach'ap'uri da q'ava.) - "I want Khachapuri and coffee." (Uses Class IV Indirect verb: Experiencer [I] is Dative m- $\rightarrow$ Dat-Nom Alignment.)Native: რას დალევ? (ras da-l-ev?) - "What will you drink?" (Uses preverb da- for Future tense: Nom-Dat Alignment.)Section 4: Advanced Grammar and Case Alignment Mastery (B2 Framework)The B2 level is the technical apex of the Georgian curriculum, focusing on the concepts of split-ergativity and the second and third screeve series.4.1. Split-Ergativity: The Case Shift ParadigmGeorgian is classified as a split-ergative language because its morphosyntactic alignment changes based on the verb’s Tense-Aspect-Mood (TAM) features.19While Series I (Present/Future) utilizes a Nominative-Accusative alignment, Series II (Aorist - Simple Past) shifts to an Ergative-Absolutive alignment. In this structure, the subject of a transitive verb must take the Ergative case, while the direct object is placed in the unmarked Nominative case (Absolutive).154.2. Series II (Aorist) ConjugationThe Aorist is formed using the perfective stem (verb root plus the appropriate preverb).20 Conjugation in Series II requires mastery of a new set of polypersonal agreement markers that simultaneously track both the Ergative subject and the Nominative object.184.3. Class III (Medial) and Class IV (Indirect) VerbsThe curriculum must address all verb classes:Class I (Transitive): Subject is Nom (Series I) or Erg (Series II).Class II (Intransitive/Passive): These verbs retain Nominative alignment across most screeves (e.g., is ič'reba $\rightarrow$ he is cutting himself).Class IV (Indirect Verbs): Verbs of emotion/perception ("to want," "to know"). The experiencer takes the Dative case, and the item experienced takes the Nominative case (m-i-nd-a $\rightarrow$ I want it).18The instructional approach must systematically link the Verb Class (I, II, III, IV) to the Screeve Series (I, II, III) to determine the correct Case Alignment (Nom-Acc, Erg-Abs, or Dat-Nom).Worked Example: Navigating the Verb MatrixTo narrate a past event ("Dato wrote the book"), the B2 learner must:Identify the Verb Class: Write is Class I (Transitive).Identify the Screeve: Simple Past means Series II (Aorist).Determine Alignment: Class I + Series II requires Ergative-Nominative alignment.Result: The subject Dato must be Ergative (Dato-m); the object book must be Nominative (cign-i).Table: Georgian Verb Alignment Summary (B2 Consolidation)Verb ClassScreeve SeriesTense/Mood FocusTransitive Subject CaseDirect Object CaseAgreement FocusClass I (Transitive)Series IPresent/Future/ImperfectNominativeDativeSubject (V-/T-)Class I (Transitive)Series IIAorist (Simple Past)ErgativeNominativePolypersonal (S & O)Class II (Intransitive)Series II/IIIAorist/PerfectNominativeN/ASubject (V-/T-)Class IV (Indirect)All SeriesTo Want, To Like, To KnowDative (Experiencer)Nominative (Item)Object (M-/G-/U- affixes)Section 5: Achieving Conversational Fluency and Cultural Competence (C1 Threshold)The C1 stage signifies the shift from grammatical mastery to stylistic flexibility, complex embedding, and deep cultural integration—the benchmark for fully conversational fluency.5.1. Advanced Syntax: Relative Clauses and EmbeddingC1 instruction must cover complex sentence construction, particularly the use of relative clauses (RCs). Restrictive RCs are formed using a wh-phrase that hosts the relativizing enclitic -c (e.g., romel-ma=c) or via the complementizer rom. Learners also explore non-finite relative clauses, such as those formed by participles (e.g., 'the read-by-Eka book').145.2. Pragmatic Mastery, Idioms, and RegisterFull conversational competence demands moving beyond literal translation to internalize idiomatic expressions, along with appropriate register switching (formal titles vs. casual colloquialisms).12Examples of Mandatory Idiomatic Study:Instead of: "You are lucky." $\rightarrow$ Say: "You were born on a happy star." (ბედნიერ ვარსკვლავზე ხარ დაბადებული)Instead of: "I am sad." $\rightarrow$ Say: "I have my ears dropped." (ყურები ჩამოყარა)Instead of: "He is stubborn." $\rightarrow$ Say: "He is sitting on a donkey." (ვირზე შეჯდომა)5.3. Cultural Immersion: The Supra and Formal EtiquetteGeorgian society is hierarchical, placing high value on tradition, age, and formalized social conduct .Early Cultural Introduction (A2/B1): Introduce the existence of the Supra (traditional feast) and the Tamada (toastmaster) early on. Learners must master the basic toast (Gaumarjos! - Cheers/Victory!). They must understand that refusal to participate in a toast is viewed as disrespect .C1 Contextualization: At C1, the focus shifts to pragmatics: knowing when to use formal (titles, surnames) versus informal (first name) register based on social hierarchy, age, and professional context.12 Advanced learners must also understand the rules of the Supra—such as not leaving the table without the Tamada's permission—as they are intrinsically linked to social and linguistic performance .Section 6: Pedagogical Implementation and Resource Strategy6.1. Strategic Learning MethodsContinuous and highly systematic review is mandatory due to Georgian’s morphological density. The curriculum must champion the use of Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS).23 Consistency is prioritized over duration; frequent, short, high-intensity study cycles (e.g., the 10-minute "Daily Trainer" approach) have been shown to be more effective than sporadic long sessions for complex languages.246.2.

Use iVoca (AI speech recognition) for objective feedback.Month 3–6 (A2)Case confusion (postposition-case sync).Fix: Create specific Anki cards pairing the postposition with the required case (e.g., -tvis $\rightarrow$ Genitive).Month 12 (B1 Plateau)Fluency stall; overwhelming verb complexity.Fix: 1-week "silent immersion" (no output, only input). Focus on Glossika/Podcasts to build intuitive fluency and listening speed.Why Persist? Emotional and Personal BenefitsPersistence unlocks rewards far beyond professional language use: C1 fluency allows genuine connection to Georgia’s famous ancient hospitality, participating in the complex cultural ritual of the Supra, reading the poetry of Shota Rustaveli, and integrating deeply into a nation renowned for its history, wine culture, and unique identity.ConclusionThe construction of the optimal Georgian course for English speakers requires a structured acknowledgment of the language's non-Indo-European complexity. Mastery is not achieved through superficial exposure but through the systematic, phased acquisition of three major features: the tripartite phonology (ejectives, aspirates, voiced stops); the agglutinative noun system (seven cases and postpositional governance); and the polypersonal verb system (screeves, version vowels, and the split-ergative alignment shift). By adopting a curriculum that prioritizes early phonetic accuracy (A1), methodical case system integration (A2), and the structural linkage of verb class to screeve and case alignment (B1–B2), and by coupling this technical mastery with intensive cultural and idiomatic training (C1), the course can effectively guide learners to professional conversational fluency. This comprehensive blueprint is designed to mitigate the risk of structural confusion and burnout inherent in learning a language with such a dense and unique morphological structure.
