      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Class II (intransitive) verbs always keep Nominative alignment for subjects, regardless of which verb series (I, II, or III) they're in. This is because they have no direct object, so there's no ergative-absolutive relationship to create.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "ვირბინ 'I run' is Class II because it has no direct object. The other verbs all have direct objects (კატას, პურს, წიგნს), making them Class I (transitive).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "a",

      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "Class III (medial) verbs have special alignment patterns - they may use Dative subject agreement or other unique patterns that don't follow the standard Class I (Nom → Erg) or Class II (always Nom) rules. They often require individual memorization.",

      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Option (b) is correct. მოვიდა [movida] 'came' is Class II (intransitive motion verb), so the subject ბავშვი stays Nominative even in Series II (Aorist). Class II verbs never take Ergative case.",

      "correctAnswer": "b",
