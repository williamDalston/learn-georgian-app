## Video Script

### Opening (0:00 - 0:45)
**[Instructor greeting with focus on pronunciation]**

"Gamarjoba! Welcome back! In our last lesson, we learned all 33 letters of the Mkhedruli alphabet. Today, we're going to dive deep into one of the most challenging - but most important - aspects of Georgian pronunciation: the tripartite system of stop consonants.

This system is crucial because Georgian distinguishes between three types of stops: voiced, aspirated, and ejective. If you don't master this distinction early, you'll struggle throughout your entire Georgian learning journey. But don't worry - by the end of this lesson, you'll understand exactly how to produce each type correctly.

Let's begin!"

### Introduction: The Three-Way Distinction (0:45 - 5:00)
**[Visual diagram showing three types of stops]**

"You might think that 'b' and 'p' are just different letters, right? In Georgian, it's more complex. We have three categories of stop consonants:

**1. Voiced Stops:** Made with your vocal cords vibrating. Examples: ბ [b], გ [g], დ [d]
**2. Aspirated Stops:** Made with a puff of air. Examples: თ [tʰ], ფ [pʰ], ქ [kʰ]
**3. Ejective Stops:** Made with a glottal closure creating a 'pop'. Examples: კ [kʼ], პ [pʼ], ტ [tʼ]

**[Show diagram with mouth positions and airflow]**

The key is that Georgian uses ALL THREE of these for similar sounds. For example, we have:
- ქ [kʰ] - aspirated k
- კ [kʼ] - ejective k  
- გ [g] - voiced g

These are THREE DIFFERENT SOUNDS to Georgian speakers, even though they might sound similar to English speakers at first."

---

### Section 1: Voiced Stops (5:00 - 15:00)
**[Focus on voiced consonants]**

"Let's start with voiced stops, which are probably the easiest for English speakers since English also has voiced consonants.

**Voiced Stop Consonants:**
- ბ [b] - like English 'b' in 'bat'
- გ [g] - like English 'g' in 'go'
- დ [d] - like English 'd' in 'dog'

**[Demonstrate each with hand on throat to show vibration]**

Try this: put your hand on your throat and say 'ბ' [b]. Feel that vibration? That's your vocal cords working. This is a voiced sound.

**[Practice words with voiced stops]**
- ბაგა (bag-a) - 'bag'
- გარე (gare) - 'outside'
- დიდი (didi) - 'big'

Practice saying these words and feel the vibration in your throat."

---

### Section 2: Aspirated Stops (15:00 - 30:00)
**[Focus on aspirated consonants]**

"Now for aspirated stops. These are released with a strong puff of air. In English, we do have some aspiration, but Georgian makes it more distinct.

**Aspirated Stop Consonants:**
- თ [tʰ] - aspirated 't', like 't' in 'top' but with more air
- ფ [pʰ] - aspirated 'p', like 'p' in 'pin' but with more air
- ქ [kʰ] - aspirated 'k', like 'k' in 'kite' but with more air

**[Demonstrate with paper in front of mouth - paper should move]**

Here's a trick: Hold a piece of paper in front of your mouth. When you say an aspirated consonant, the paper should move! Try it:
- თხა (t'xa) - 'goat' - paper should move
- ფული (puli) - 'money' - paper should move
- ქალაქი (kalaki) - 'city' - paper should move

**[Show IPA symbol [ʰ] and explain]**

The little 'h' in [tʰ] represents the aspiration - the puff of air. This is what distinguishes aspirated stops from ejective stops."

---

### Section 3: Ejective Stops - The Challenge (30:00 - 50:00)
**[Deep dive into ejective consonants]**

"Now for the challenging part: ejective consonants. These don't exist in English, so they'll feel completely new.

**Ejective Stop Consonants:**
- კ [kʼ] - ejective 'k'
- პ [pʼ] - ejective 'p'
- ტ [tʼ] - ejective 't'
- წ [tsʼ] - ejective 'ts'
- ჭ [tʃʼ] - ejective 'ch'
- ყ [qʼ] - ejective 'q'

**[Slow-motion demonstration with throat diagram]**

Here's how to make an ejective:

1. **Close your glottis** (the space between your vocal cords) - like you're holding your breath
2. **Build up pressure** behind the closure in your mouth
3. **Release with a 'pop'** sound

**[Visual: Slow-motion animation of glottal closure]**

Try this step by step:
- Close your throat (glottal closure) - you should feel pressure
- Now say 'k' BUT keep your throat closed
- Release with a pop: კ [kʼ]

**[Practice words with ejectives]**
- კაცი (k'ats-i) - 'man' - notice the pop on კ
- პაპა (p'ap'a) - 'grandfather' - pop on პ
- ტბა (t'ba) - 'lake' - pop on ტ
- წყალი (ts'q'ali) - 'water' - pops on წ and ყ

**[Troubleshooting tips]**

If you're struggling:
1. Feel your throat - it should feel constricted before the pop
2. The sound should be sharp and crisp, not breathy
3. Practice in front of a mirror to see your throat move
4. Compare: თ [tʰ] (breathy) vs ტ [tʼ] (sharp pop)"

---

### Section 4: Comparison and Contrast (50:00 - 55:00)
**[Side-by-side comparison]**

"Let's compare these sounds side by side:

**The 'T' Trio:**
- თ [tʰ] - Aspirated: breathy, with air puff
- ტ [tʼ] - Ejective: sharp, with glottal pop
- დ [d] - Voiced: vibrating vocal cords

**[Audio comparison - play each sound three times]**

Listen carefully:
- თ [tʰ] თ [tʰ] თ [tʰ] - hear the air?
- ტ [tʼ] ტ [tʼ] ტ [tʼ] - hear the pop?
- დ [d] დ [d] დ [d] - feel the vibration?

**[Practice minimal pairs]**
- თხა [tʰxa] (goat) vs ტბა [tʼba] (lake)
- კაცი [kʼatsi] (man) vs ქალაქი [kʰalakʰi] (city)

**[Common mistakes to avoid]**

English speakers often:
- ❌ Make ejectives too breathy (confusing with aspirated)
- ❌ Make aspirated too weak (missing the air puff)
- ❌ Forget to close glottis for ejectives

The key: ejectives should feel like a 'pop' in your throat, not air coming out of your mouth."

### Practice Exercise: Pronunciation Drills (55:00 - 58:00)
**[Interactive practice]**

"Now let's practice! I'll say a word, and you try to identify which type of stop consonant you hear:

1. ბაგა (bag-a) - What type? [Voiced - ბ]
2. თხა (t'xa) - What type? [Aspirated - თ]
3. კაცი (k'ats-i) - What type? [Ejective - კ]

**[Practice production]**

Now you try! Repeat after me:
- ბ [b] - voiced
- თ [tʰ] - aspirated  
- ტ [tʼ] - ejective

Keep practicing - this takes time!"

---

### Summary (58:00 - 60:00)
**[Review key points]**

"Let's review what we learned today:

1. **Voiced stops** [b, g, d]: Vocal cords vibrate
2. **Aspirated stops** [tʰ, pʰ, kʰ]: Released with puff of air
3. **Ejective stops** [kʼ, pʼ, tʼ]: Made with glottal closure and pop

The tripartite distinction is one of Georgian's unique features. Master this, and you're well on your way to good pronunciation!

**Key practice tip:** Spend at least 15 minutes daily practicing ejective consonants. Use the audio files I've provided and record yourself to compare."

---

### Assignment (60:00)
**[Homework]**

"Before the next lesson:

1. **Daily ejective practice** - 15 minutes minimum
   - Use audio files: კ, პ, ტ, წ, ჭ, ყ
   - Record yourself and compare with native audio
   
2. **Minimal pair practice**
   - Practice: თ vs ტ, ქ vs კ, ფ vs პ
   - Use the pronunciation drills worksheet
   
3. **Feel the difference**
   - Put hand on throat for voiced
   - Use paper test for aspirated
   - Practice glottal closure for ejective

4. **Watch tutorial videos** (optional)
   - Search 'Georgian ejective consonants' on YouTube
   - Watch native speakers' mouth movements

Remember: Pronunciation fossilization is real - practice correctly now, or you'll struggle later!

Nakhvamdis! See you in the next lesson!"
