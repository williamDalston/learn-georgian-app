### Opening (0:00 - 0:50)
**[Instructor greeting with enthusiasm]**

"Gamarjoba! Welcome back! We've covered Class I transitive verbs and their Ergative case marking in Series II and III. But Georgian has more verb classes, and they don't all follow the same pattern.

Today, we're going to explore Class II (intransitive) verbs and Class III (medial) verbs. These verb classes behave differently from Class I, and understanding these differences is crucial for mastering Georgian grammar. By the end of this lesson, you'll know exactly which verbs use Ergative case and which always stay in Nominative - regardless of tense. Let's dive in!"

### Introduction: Why Verb Classes Matter (0:50 - 8:00)
**[Show comparison chart: Class I vs Class II vs Class III]**

"Remember from previous lessons: Georgian verbs are classified into four main classes based on their transitivity and case alignment patterns:

**Class I: Transitive Verbs**
- Have a direct object
- Use Nominative-Accusative in Series I
- Use Ergative-Absolutive in Series II/III
- Example: ვხედავ კატას [vkhedav kat'as] 'I see the cat'

**Class II: Intransitive Verbs**
- Have NO direct object
- Always use Nominative alignment (all series)
- Subject always stays Nominative
- Example: ვირბინე [virbine] 'I ran'

**Class III: Medial Verbs**
- Special verbs with unique alignment patterns
- Some are 'inversion' verbs (subject-object relationship flips)
- Example: ვწერ [vts'er] 'I write (it)'

**Class IV: Indirect Verbs**
- Express emotions, perception, knowledge
- Use Dative-Nominative alignment
- Example: მინდა [minda] 'I want'

Today, we focus on Class II and Class III."

### Main Content Section 1: Class II Intransitive Verbs (8:00 - 30:00)
**[Show Class II verb examples]**

"Let's start with Class II - intransitive verbs. These are verbs that don't take a direct object. The key feature: **Class II verbs ALWAYS keep Nominative alignment, even in Series II and III.**

**Key Rule: Class II verbs = No Ergative, ever!**

**[Show alignment comparison]**

**Class I (Transitive) - Changes Alignment:**
- Series I: მე ვხედავ კატას [me vkhedav kat'as] 'I see the cat'
  - მე = Nominative (present tense)
- Series II: მე ვნახე კატა [me vnakhe kat'a] 'I saw the cat'
  - მე = Ergative (past tense, transitive)

**Class II (Intransitive) - Always Nominative:**
- Series I: მე ვირბინ [me virbin] 'I run'
  - მე = Nominative
- Series II: მე ვირბინე [me virbine] 'I ran'
  - მე = Nominative (still Nominative in past!)

**[Show more Class II examples]**

**Common Class II Verbs:**

1. **Motion Verbs:**
- ირბინებს [irbinebs] 'runs'
- მიდის [midis] 'goes'
- მოდის [modis] 'comes'
- დგას [dgass] 'stands'
- ზის [zis] 'sits'

2. **State Verbs:**
- არის [aris] 'is' (exists)
- დგას [dgass] 'stands'
- ზის [zis] 'sits'
- წევს [ts'evs] 'lies'

3. **Emotion/State Change:**
- ღიმის [ghimis] 'smiles'
- ტირის [t'iris] 'cries'
- იცვლება [itsvleba] 'changes'

**[Show conjugations across series]**

**Pattern:**
მე ვირბინ [me virbin] 'I run' (Series I, Present)
- Subject: Nominative

მე ვირბინე [me virbine] 'I ran' (Series II, Aorist)
- Subject: Nominative (NOT Ergative!)

მე ვარ გარბენილი [me var garbenili] 'I have run' (Series III, Perfect)
- Subject: Nominative (still Nominative!)

**Important:** Class II verbs NEVER use Ergative case, even though they're in Series II or III. This is because they're intransitive - they have no object to create an ergative-absolutive pattern with."

### Practice Exercise 1: Identifying Class II Verbs (30:00 - 35:00)
**[Interactive identification exercise]**

"Let's practice! Which of these are Class II (intransitive) verbs?

1. ვირბინ [virbin] 'I run' - **Class II** (no object)
2. ვხედავ კატას [vkhedav kat'as] 'I see the cat' - **Class I** (has object: cat)
3. მოვდივარ [movdivar] 'I come' - **Class II** (no object)
4. ვჭამ პური [vch'am p'uri] 'I eat bread' - **Class I** (has object: bread)

The key question: **Does the verb have a direct object?** If no → Class II. If yes → Class I."

### Main Content Section 2: Class III Medial Verbs (35:00 - 55:00)
**[Show Class III verb introduction]**

"Now for the more complex class: Class III - medial verbs. These are special verbs with unique alignment patterns. Some linguists call them 'inversion' verbs because the subject-object relationship works differently.

**Key Features of Class III:**
1. They often describe actions done 'for oneself' or 'to oneself'
2. They have special case alignment patterns
3. They behave differently from Class I and II

**[Show Class III examples]**

**Common Class III Verbs:**

1. **Washing/Dressing:**
- იბანს [ibans] 'washes (oneself)'
- იცვამს [itsvams] 'puts on / dresses (oneself)'
- ივიწროებს [ivits'roebs] 'narrows (itself)'

2. **Movement/Position:**
- ვწერ [vts'er] 'I write (it)' - can be transitive but behaves differently
- იმწარებს [imts'arebs] 'spreads (itself)'

**[Show case alignment for Class III]**

**Class III Case Alignment:**

**Pattern 1: Inversion Verbs**
Some Class III verbs work like inversion verbs:
- The logical object appears in Nominative
- The logical subject appears in Dative or different case

**Example:**
ჩემს ვიცვამ [chems vitsvam] 'I put on (myself)'
- ჩემს [chems] = 'my' (Dative - to/for me)
- Verb agrees with the Dative (not Nominative subject)

**Pattern 2: Medial-Reflexive**
Some Class III verbs are reflexive-like:
- The action is done to oneself
- Special verb morphology

**Important Note:** Class III verbs are less common and often require memorization. The key is recognizing them and applying their special alignment rules.

**[Show more examples with conjugations]**

**Class III in Different Series:**

**Series I:**
ჩემს ვიცვამ [chems vitsvam] 'I put on (myself)'
- Dative subject agreement

**Series II:**
ჩემს ვიცვი [chems vitsvi] 'I put on (myself)'
- Still Dative subject agreement

**Key Difference:** Class III verbs don't follow the simple Class I pattern of Nominative → Ergative shift. They have their own patterns that need to be learned."

### Comparison: All Three Classes (55:00 - 60:00)
**[Show comprehensive comparison table]**

"Let's compare all three classes side by side:

**[Show table]**

| Verb Class | Transitivity | Series I Alignment | Series II Alignment | Example |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Class I** | Transitive | Nom-Acc | Erg-Abs | ვხედავ კატას → ვნახე კატა |
| **Class II** | Intransitive | Nom | Nom (always!) | ვირბინ → ვირბინე |
| **Class III** | Medial | Special | Special | ვიცვამ → ვიცვი |

**Memory Tip:**
- Class I = Changes alignment (Nom → Erg)
- Class II = Never changes (always Nom)
- Class III = Special pattern (memorize)

**[Show decision tree]**

**Decision Tree:**
1. Does verb have direct object? 
   - NO → Class II (always Nominative)
   - YES → Continue to step 2
2. Is it a special medial/reflexive verb?
   - YES → Class III (special alignment)
   - NO → Class I (follows Nom → Erg shift)"

### Summary (60:00 - 63:00)
**[Review key points]**

"Let's summarize what we learned:

1. **Class II verbs are intransitive** - they have no direct object
2. **Class II verbs always use Nominative alignment** - even in Series II and III
3. **Class III verbs are medial/inversion verbs** - they have special alignment patterns
4. **Class III verbs require memorization** - learn them individually
5. **The key distinction:** Class I changes alignment, Class II doesn't, Class III has special patterns

Remember: Not all verbs in Series II/III take Ergative case. Only Class I (transitive) verbs do!"

---

### Assignment (63:00 - 65:00)
**[Practice exercises]**

"Before the next lesson, please:

1. **Memorize common Class II verbs** - Make flashcards for motion and state verbs
2. **Practice identifying verb classes** - Go through sentences and identify Class I, II, or III
3. **Practice Class II conjugations** - Conjugate intransitive verbs across all series
4. **Study Class III examples** - Focus on the special alignment patterns
5. **Complete the exercises** - Practice with the provided exercises

The key to mastering this is recognizing the verb class first, then applying the correct case alignment rules.

See you in the next lesson where we'll explore Series III (Perfect and Pluperfect) in depth! Nakhvamdis!"
