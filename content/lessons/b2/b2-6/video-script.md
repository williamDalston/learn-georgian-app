### Opening (0:00 - 0:30)
**[Instructor greeting with confidence and excitement]**

"Gamarjoba! Welcome to the culminating lesson of B2! Congratulations - you've learned Series I, II, and III. You've mastered the four verb classes. You understand split-ergativity and case shifts. Now, we're putting it ALL together. Today, you'll learn to **systematically navigate** the complete Georgian verb system like a pro! This is the master lesson that ties everything together!"

---

### Introduction (0:30 - 5:00)
**[Display complete verb system overview]**

"In Georgian, we have:
- **4 Verb Classes** (I, II, III, IV)
- **3 Screeve Series** (I, II, III)
- **Multiple case alignments** (Nominative-Accusative, Ergative-Absolutive, Dative-Nominative)

**[Show visual matrix]**

That's 12 possible combinations! But don't worry - once you understand the **systematic patterns**, you can predict the conjugation for ANY verb in ANY tense.

**[Display example]**

Let me show you what mastery looks like:

Given: Verb 'to see' - ხედვა [khedva]
- You should instantly know: **Class I, Transitive**
- In Series I (Present): Nominative-Accusative alignment
- In Series II (Aorist): Ergative-Absolutive alignment  
- In Series III (Perfect): Back to Nominative-Accusative alignment
- And you can predict all the conjugations!

This is what we're building toward today!"

**[Clear board with excitement]**

### Main Content Section 1: The Complete Matrix Overview (5:00 - 25:00)
**[Display full matrix table]**

"Let me show you the complete system at a glance:

**[Show comprehensive matrix]**

| Verb Class | Description | Series I (Present) | Series II (Aorist) | Series III (Perfect) |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Class I** | Transitive (direct object) | Nominative-Accusative | **Ergative-Absolutive** | Nominative-Accusative |
| **Class II** | Intransitive (no object) | Nominative | **Nominative** | Nominative |
| **Class III** | Medial | Special pattern | Special pattern | Special pattern |
| **Class IV** | Indirect (emotions/ perception) | Dative-Nominative | Dative-Nominative | Dative-Nominative |

**[Highlight key insight]**

Look at this pattern! The **case shift** (Nominative to Ergative) happens ONLY in Series II for Class I verbs. All other combinations remain stable!

**[Show why]**

Let me explain WHY this pattern exists:

**Class I in Series I (Present):**
- Subject: Nominative
- Object: Dative (often called 'Accusative' in this context)
- Example: მე კატას ვხედავ [me k'at'as vkhedav] - 'I see the cat'
  - მე [me] = Nominative subject
  - კატას [k'at'as] = Dative object

**Class I in Series II (Aorist):**
- Subject: **Ergative** (THE BIG CHANGE!)
- Object: Nominative (Absolutive)
- Example: მე კატა ვნახე [me k'ata vnakhe] - 'I saw the cat'
  - მე [me] = Ergative subject (can be marked with -მ [m])
  - კატა [k'ata] = Nominative/Absolutive object

**Class I in Series III (Perfect):**
- Subject: Nominative (shifts BACK!)
- Object: Dative (shifts BACK!)
- Example: მე კატას ვნახიყავ [me k'at'as vnakhik'av] - 'I have seen the cat'
  - Back to Nominative-Dative alignment!

**[Show Class II comparison]**

**Class II (Intransitive) - NO SHIFT:**
- Series I: Subject in Nominative
- Series II: Subject in Nominative (NO ERGATIVE!)
- Series III: Subject in Nominative

Example: მუშაობა [mushaoba] - to work
- Series I: მე ვმუშაობ [me vmushaob] - 'I work' (Nominative)
- Series II: მე ვიმუშავე [me vimushave] - 'I worked' (STILL Nominative!)
- Series III: მე ვიმუშავიყავ [me vimushavik'av] - 'I have worked' (STILL Nominative!)

**[Show Class IV comparison]**

**Class IV (Indirect) - NO SHIFT:**
- All series: Subject in Dative, Object in Nominative
- Example: ყველას [khvelas] - to love
  - Series I: შენ მიყვარხარ [shen mikhv'ar'khar] - 'I love you'
    - შენ [shen] = Nominative object
    - მიყვარხარ [mikhv'ar'khar] = 'I love you' with Dative subject 'I'
  - Series II: შენ მეყვაროდ [shen mekhv'arod] - 'I loved you'
    - Same alignment!
  - Series III: შენ მეყვარდმჰყონ [shen mekhvardmhkon] - 'I have loved you'
    - Same alignment!

**[Clear and emphasize]**

Do you see the system? Only Class I (Transitive) verbs shift case alignment in Series II. Everything else stays consistent!"

### Main Content Section 2: Systematic Conjugation Strategy (25:00 - 45:00)
**[Display step-by-step approach]**

"Now let me give you a **systematic process** to conjugate ANY verb:

**[Show 5-step method]**

**Step 1: Identify the Verb Class**
Ask: Does it take a direct object?
- Yes → Class I
- No → Is it an emotion/perception verb? → Class IV
- No → Intransitive → Class II or III

**[Show examples]**

Let's practice:
1. ხედვა [khedva] - to see
   - Takes object? YES (I see what? A cat, a book, etc.)
   - **Class I**

2. მუშაობა [mushaoba] - to work
   - Takes object? NO (You don't 'work something')
   - Emotion/perception? NO
   - **Class II**

3. ყველას [khvelas] - to love
   - Takes object? YES (I love whom?)
   - But it's an emotion verb
   - **Class IV**

**[Continue step-by-step]**

**Step 2: Determine the Series**
What timeframe?
- Present/Future → Series I
- Simple Past → Series II
- Perfect/Pluperfect → Series III

**Step 3: Predict Case Alignment**
Use our matrix!
- Class I + Series I → Nominative-Accusative
- Class I + Series II → **Ergative-Absolutive** ← THE SHIFT
- Class I + Series III → Nominative-Accusative
- Class II + Any Series → Nominative
- Class IV + Any Series → Dative-Nominative

**Step 4: Apply Conjugation Pattern**
Use the correct stem and markers for that Class-Series combination.

**Step 5: Check Your Work**
Does the case alignment match your prediction?"

**[Show complete example]**

"Let me walk you through a complete example:

**Verb:** წერა [ts'era] - to write
**Sentence:** 'The student writes a book'

**My process:**
1. Class? Takes object (writes what? A book) → **Class I**
2. Series? Present tense → **Series I**
3. Case alignment? Class I + Series I → **Nominative-Accusative**
4. Conjugation: მოსწავლე წიგნს წერს [mosts'avle ts'igns ts'ers]
   - მოსწავლე [mosts'avle] = Nominative subject
   - წიგნს [ts'igns] = Dative object
   - წერს [ts'ers] = Series I, 3rd person

**Now let's change to past:**

'Same sentence in past'
1. Class? **Class I** (same)
2. Series? Past → **Series II**
3. Case alignment? Class I + Series II → **Ergative-Absolutive** (SHIFT!)
4. Conjugation: მოსწავლემ დაწერა წიგნი [mosts'avlem dats'era ts'igni]
   - მოსწავლემ [mosts'avlem] = Ergative subject (notice -მ [m])
   - დაწერა [dats'era] = Series II, 3rd person
   - წიგნი [ts'igni] = Nominative/Absolutive object

See the case shift? The subject added -მ [m] (Ergative), and the object lost its case marker!"

### Main Content Section 3: Complex Sentence Analysis (45:00 - 62:00)
**[Display complex sentences]**

"Now let's analyze REAL complex sentences with multiple verbs:

**Example 1: Mixed Series**
გუშინ მე დავუძახებდი დედა, რომელმაც ამბობს მე მიმედებია [gushin me davudz'ak'hebdi deda, romelmats amobs me mimedebia]

Let's break it down:
1. **გუშინ** [gushin] - yesterday (time marker)
2. **მე** [me] - I (subject)
3. **დავუძახებდი** [davudz'ak'hebdi] - 'I called' (Series II, Aorist)
   - Class I (transitive)
   - Series II → Ergative-Absolutive
   - მე is Ergative subject
4. **დედა** [deda] - mother (Nominative object in Series II)
5. **რომელმაც** [romelmats] - 'who' (relative pronoun, Ergative -მან [man] because it's subject of Series II verb)
6. **ამბობს** [ambobs] - says (Series I, Present)
   - Class I (transitive)
   - Series I → Nominative-Accusative
7. **მე მიმედებია** [me mimedebia] - 'I hope' (Series I, Present)
   - Class IV (indirect verb)
   - Series I → Dative-Nominative
   - მე [me] is Dative subject (experiencer)

**[Clear and show another]**

**Example 2: Perfect vs Aorist Together**
როცა ჩავედი სკოლაში, უკვე დავასრულედმიყავ საშინაოდრო, მაგრამ დავწერე მხოლოდ გუშინ [rotsa ch'avedi sk'olashi, uk've davasruledmik'av sashinaodro, magram davts'ere mkholod gushin]

Breakdown:
1. **როცა ჩავედი** [rotsa ch'avedi] - 'when I arrived' (Series II, Aorist)
2. **უკვე დავასრულედმიყავ** [uk've davasruledmik'av] - 'I had already finished' (Series III, Pluperfect)
   - Pluperfect shows this happened BEFORE the arrival
3. **დავწერე** [davts'ere] - 'I wrote' (Series II, Aorist)
   - Shows the homework was written yesterday (simple past fact)

**[Show the time sequencing]**

Timeline:
1. Homework written (yesterday) - Aorist
2. Homework finished (before arrival) - Pluperfect
3. I arrived at school (past reference point) - Aorist

The Pluperfect creates the time sequence!"

### Main Content Section 4: Practical Application & Common Patterns (62:00 - 70:00)
**[Display practical patterns]**

"Let me show you common patterns you'll encounter:

**Pattern 1: Transitive Verbs with Object Drop**
მე ვნახე [me vnakhe] - 'I saw'
- Class I, Series II
- Object is implied (what did you see? unspecified)
- Still uses Ergative subject even without explicit object

**Pattern 2: Perfect for Life Experience**
ოდესმე ყველასაგან გიყვარხარ ის? [odesme khvelasagan gikhv'ar'khar is?]
- 'Have you ever loved him/her?'
- Perfect emphasizes life experience
- Class IV (indirect)

**Pattern 3: Negation Across Series**
Series I: მე არ ვმუშაობ [me ar vmushaob] - 'I don't work'
Series II: მე არ ვიმუშავე [me ar vimushave] - 'I didn't work'
Series III: მე არ ვიმუშავიყავ [me ar vimushavik'av] - 'I haven't worked'
- Negation marker არ [ar] stays the same

**Pattern 4: Questions**
Series I: სად მუშაობ? [sad mushaob?] - 'Where do you work?'
Series II: სად იმუშავე? [sad imushave?] - 'Where did you work?'
Series III: სად იმუშავიყავ? [sad imushavik'av?] - 'Where have you worked?'
- Question words stay consistent

**[Encourage pattern recognition]**

Once you internalize these patterns, you'll conjugate naturally!"

### Summary (73:00 - 75:00)
**[Final comprehensive review]**

"Congratulations! You now understand the complete Georgian verb system! Let's review the master matrix:

**[Display final matrix]**

**The Pattern:**
- **Class I** = Transitive verbs that shift to Ergative in Series II
- **Class II** = Intransitive verbs that stay Nominative
- **Class III** = Medial verbs with special patterns
- **Class IV** = Indirect verbs that use Dative-Nominative

**[Five steps]**

Your systematic approach:
1. Identify Class
2. Determine Series  
3. Predict Alignment
4. Apply Conjugation
5. Verify Cases

**[Encouraging tone]**

You've learned something incredibly advanced! Many Georgian learners never fully master this matrix. You now have the tools to systematically understand and produce ANY Georgian verb form in ANY tense!"
