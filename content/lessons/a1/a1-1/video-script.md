### Opening (0:00 - 0:30)
**[Instructor greeting with warm smile]**

"Gamarjoba! Welcome to your first lesson in Georgian. I'm so excited to begin this journey with you. Today, we're going to explore the beautiful Georgian alphabet called Mkhedruli. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to recognize all 33 letters and understand the unique characteristics of Georgian writing. Let's begin!"

### Introduction (0:30 - 3:00)
**[Show historical context: Ancient Georgian manuscripts, Mkhedruli script examples]**

"The Georgian alphabet is one of the world's unique writing systems. There are actually three Georgian alphabets - Asomtavruli, Nuskhuri, and Mkhedruli - but today we use Mkhedruli exclusively. This script has been used since the 11th century and consists of 33 letters, each representing a distinct sound.

What makes Georgian special is that there's no distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters. Unlike English, where 'A' and 'a' look different, in Georgian, every letter has only one form. This actually makes learning easier once you memorize the letters!

Let's start by looking at the complete alphabet on screen."

### Main Content Section 1: Letter Groups (3:00 - 15:00)
**[Break down alphabet into manageable groups]**

"Let's organize these 33 letters into groups to make learning easier. First, let's look at the vowels:

**Vowels (5 letters):**
- ა [a] - like 'a' in 'father'
- ე [e] - like 'e' in 'bed'
- ი [i] - like 'ee' in 'see'
- ო [o] - like 'o' in 'go'
- უ [u] - like 'oo' in 'moon'

**[Show each vowel with mouth position and pronunciation]**

Now, the consonants. Georgian has many consonants that might be new to you. Let's start with familiar sounds:

**Familiar Consonants:**
- ბ [b] - like English 'b'
- გ [g] - like English 'g' in 'go'
- დ [d] - like English 'd'
- ვ [v] - like English 'v'
- ზ [z] - like English 'z'
- ლ [l] - like English 'l'
- მ [m] - like English 'm'
- ნ [n] - like English 'n'
- რ [r] - like English 'r' (but we'll practice the trill later)
- ს [s] - like English 's'
- ფ [p] - like English 'p'
- ქ [k] - like English 'k'
- ჰ [h] - like English 'h'

**[Show each letter with hand gestures for pronunciation]**

---

### Main Content Section 2: Special Georgian Consonants (15:00 - 30:00)
**[Introduce unique sounds]**

"Now, here's where Georgian gets interesting. We have consonant pairs that might sound similar but are actually different:

**Aspirated Consonants (with a puff of air):**
- თ [tʰ] - aspirated 't', like 't' in 'top' with emphasis
- ჩ [tʃʰ] - aspirated 'ch', like 'ch' in 'chair' with emphasis

**Ejective Consonants (with glottal closure):**
- კ [kʼ] - ejective 'k', made with a 'pop' in the throat
- პ [pʼ] - ejective 'p', made with a 'pop' in the throat
- ტ [tʼ] - ejective 't', made with a 'pop' in the throat
- წ [tsʼ] - ejective 'ts', like 'ts' in 'cats' but with a pop
- ჭ [tʃʼ] - ejective 'ch', like 'ch' but with a pop
- ყ [qʼ] - ejective 'q', like a 'k' made in the back of the throat

**[Demonstrate each ejective with slow-motion pronunciation]**

**Other Unique Sounds:**
- ჟ [ʒ] - like 's' in 'measure'
- ღ [ɣ] - guttural fricative, like Spanish 'g' in 'lago'
- ხ [x] - guttural fricative, like German 'ch' in 'Bach'
- შ [ʃ] - like 'sh' in 'shoe'
- ც [ts] - like 'ts' in 'cats'
- ძ [dz] - like 'dz' in 'adze'
- ჯ [dʒ] - like 'j' in 'judge'

**[Show IPA symbols and mouth diagrams for each]**

### Practice Exercise 1: Letter Recognition (30:00 - 37:00)
**[Interactive letter matching game]**

"Now, let's practice! On your screen, you'll see Georgian letters appear. Try to identify which sound they make. Don't worry if you make mistakes - that's part of learning!

**[Show letters one by one, pause for student response]**

- What sound does ა make? [a]
- What sound does კ make? [kʼ] - remember, it's an ejective!
- What sound does თ make? [tʰ] - aspirated!

Great job! Keep practicing these at your own pace."

---

### Summary (37:00 - 42:00)
**[Review all 33 letters]**

"Let's review what we learned today:

1. Georgian uses the Mkhedruli alphabet with 33 letters
2. There are no uppercase or lowercase letters - one form for each letter
3. We have 5 vowels: ა, ე, ი, ო, უ
4. We have 28 consonants, including unique sounds like ejectives and gutturals
5. Ejective consonants are made with a glottal closure - practice these!

The key to mastering the alphabet is repetition. Write each letter, say each sound, and be patient with yourself."

---

### Assignment (42:00 - 45:00)
**[Practice exercises]**

"Before the next lesson, please:

1. **Write each letter 10 times** - Practice the handwriting worksheets I've provided
2. **Practice pronunciation** - Listen to the audio files and repeat each letter sound
3. **Flashcards** - Create flashcards with the Georgian letter on one side and the sound on the other
4. **Identify letters** - Try to find Georgian text online and identify which letters you recognize

Don't worry about memorizing everything perfectly - we'll keep practicing in future lessons. The goal is familiarity, not perfection!

**[Show practice worksheet preview]**

Remember: Georgian script is beautiful and unique. Enjoy the process of learning it!

See you in the next lesson! Nakhvamdis!"

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Confusing Similar-Looking Letters

**Problem:** Students often mix up letters that look similar:
- კ (kʼ) vs ქ (k) vs ყ (qʼ)
- პ (pʼ) vs ფ (p)
- ტ (tʼ) vs თ (tʰ)

**Solution:**
- **Pay attention to the small differences** - take time to notice letter shapes
- **Practice distinguishing** ejective vs aspirated vs voiced sounds
- **Use mnemonics** - "კ looks like a K with a loop" vs "ქ is simpler"

### Mistake 2: Not Hearing the Difference Between Ejectives and Regular Consonants

**Problem:** English speakers struggle to hear the difference between:
- ქალაქი (kalaki - city, with aspirated ქ) vs კაცი (k'atsi - man, with ejective კ)
- ფული (puli - money, with aspirated ფ) vs პაპა (p'ap'a - grandfather, with ejective პ)

**Solution:**
- **Listen carefully to native audio** - the difference is subtle but important
- **Practice minimal pairs** - say contrasting words back-to-back
- **Feel the difference physically** - ejectives have a throat "pop"
- **Use the paper test** - hold paper in front of mouth to feel aspiration

### Mistake 3: Trying to Memorize All 33 Letters at Once

**Problem:** Students try to memorize everything in one session and get overwhelmed

**Solution:**
- **Learn in groups** - vowels first, then familiar consonants, then unique sounds
- **Practice daily** - 10-15 minutes daily is better than one long session
- **Use spaced repetition** - review letters from previous sessions
- **Focus on recognition first** - don't worry about writing perfectly yet

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Pronunciation Practice

**Problem:** Students focus only on recognizing letters, not producing sounds correctly

**Solution:**
- **Practice pronunciation daily** - listen and repeat after native audio
- **Record yourself** - compare your pronunciation to native speakers
- **Focus on difficult sounds** - give extra time to ejectives and gutturals
- **Use the audio scripts** - follow pronunciation guides step-by-step

### Mistake 5: Writing Letters Incorrectly (Stroke Order)

**Problem:** Students develop bad handwriting habits early

**Solution:**
- **Follow stroke order** - learn the correct way to write each letter
- **Practice slowly** - accuracy is more important than speed
- **Use handwriting worksheets** - follow provided templates
- **Start with large strokes** - gradually make them smaller

### Mistake 6: Not Understanding the Three Consonant Series

**Problem:** Students don't understand voiced vs aspirated vs ejective distinction

**Solution:**
- **Learn the three-way distinction** - this is fundamental to Georgian
- **Practice each series separately** - master one before moving to next
- **Use minimal pair practice** - compare voiced/aspirated/ejective triplets
- **Feel the physical difference** - voice vibration, air puff, throat pop

## Pronunciation Emphasis Notes

### Key Pronunciation Points

1. **Ejective Consonants (კ, პ, ტ, წ, ჭ, ყ)**
   - **Emphasize:** These are NOT the same as English k, p, t, ch, ts, q
   - **Demonstration:** Show throat closure and "pop" release
   - **Practice:** Compare ejective vs aspirated vs voiced triplets
   - **Common error:** Replacing ejectives with regular consonants

2. **Aspirated Consonants (თ, ჩ, ფ, ქ, ხ, ჩ)**
   - **Emphasize:** Release with a clear puff of air
   - **Demonstration:** Use paper test - paper should move
   - **Practice:** Exaggerate aspiration at first, then naturalize
   - **Common error:** Not aspirating enough (sounds like voiced)

3. **Guttural Sounds (ხ, ღ, ყ)**
   - **Emphasize:** Made in the back of the throat
   - **Demonstration:** Show tongue position and throat tension
   - **Practice:** Start with easier gutturals, progress to harder ones
   - **Common error:** Using English "h" or "g" instead

4. **Vowel Sounds (ა, ე, ი, ო, უ)**
   - **Emphasize:** Pure vowel sounds, no diphthongs
   - **Demonstration:** Show mouth position for each
   - **Practice:** Hold each vowel sound steady
   - **Common error:** Adding English diphthongs (ay, ey, etc.)

### Pronunciation Practice Sequence

**Recommended order:**
1. **Vowels** (5 letters) - easiest to master
2. **Familiar consonants** (ბ, გ, დ, ვ, ზ, ლ, მ, ნ, რ, ს, ფ, ქ, ჰ) - similar to English
3. **Other unique sounds** (ჟ, შ, ჩ, ც, ძ, წ, ჭ, ჯ) - distinct but not too difficult
4. **Aspirated consonants** (თ, ჩ, ფ, ქ) - requires air control
5. **Gutturals** (ხ, ღ) - throat position
6. **Ejectives** (კ, პ, ტ, წ, ჭ, ყ) - most challenging
