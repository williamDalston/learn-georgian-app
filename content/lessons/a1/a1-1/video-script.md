### Opening (0:00 - 0:30)
**[Instructor greeting with warm smile]**

"Gamarjoba! Welcome to your first lesson in Georgian. I'm so excited to begin this journey with you. Today, we're going to explore the beautiful Georgian alphabet called Mkhedruli. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to recognize all 33 letters and understand the unique characteristics of Georgian writing. Let's begin!"

### Introduction (0:30 - 3:00)
**[Show historical context: Ancient Georgian manuscripts, Mkhedruli script examples]**

"The Georgian alphabet is one of the world's unique writing systems. There are actually three Georgian alphabets - Asomtavruli, Nuskhuri, and Mkhedruli - but today we use Mkhedruli exclusively. This script has been used since the 11th century and consists of 33 letters, each representing a distinct sound.

What makes Georgian special is that there's no distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters. Unlike English, where 'A' and 'a' look different, in Georgian, every letter has only one form. This actually makes learning easier once you memorize the letters!

Let's start by looking at the complete alphabet on screen."

### Main Content Section 1: Letter Groups (3:00 - 15:00)
**[Break down alphabet into manageable groups]**

"Let's organize these 33 letters into groups to make learning easier. First, let's look at the vowels:

**Vowels (5 letters):**
- ა [a] - like 'a' in 'father'
- ე [e] - like 'e' in 'bed'
- ი [i] - like 'ee' in 'see'
- ო [o] - like 'o' in 'go'
- უ [u] - like 'oo' in 'moon'

**[Show each vowel with mouth position and pronunciation]**

Now, the consonants. Georgian has many consonants that might be new to you. Let's start with familiar sounds:

**Familiar Consonants:**
- ბ [b] - like English 'b'
- გ [g] - like English 'g' in 'go'
- დ [d] - like English 'd'
- ვ [v] - like English 'v'
- ზ [z] - like English 'z'
- ლ [l] - like English 'l'
- მ [m] - like English 'm'
- ნ [n] - like English 'n'
- რ [r] - like English 'r' (but we'll practice the trill later)
- ს [s] - like English 's'
- ფ [p] - like English 'p'
- ქ [k] - like English 'k'
- ჰ [h] - like English 'h'

**[Show each letter with hand gestures for pronunciation]**

### Main Content Section 2: Special Georgian Consonants (15:00 - 30:00)
**[Introduce unique sounds]**

"Now, here's where Georgian gets interesting. We have consonant pairs that might sound similar but are actually different:

**Aspirated Consonants (with a puff of air):**
- თ [tʰ] - aspirated 't', like 't' in 'top' with emphasis
- ჩ [tʃʰ] - aspirated 'ch', like 'ch' in 'chair' with emphasis

**Ejective Consonants (with glottal closure):**
- კ [kʼ] - ejective 'k', made with a 'pop' in the throat
- პ [pʼ] - ejective 'p', made with a 'pop' in the throat
- ტ [tʼ] - ejective 't', made with a 'pop' in the throat
- წ [tsʼ] - ejective 'ts', like 'ts' in 'cats' but with a pop
- ჭ [tʃʼ] - ejective 'ch', like 'ch' but with a pop
- ყ [qʼ] - ejective 'q', like a 'k' made in the back of the throat

**[Demonstrate each ejective with slow-motion pronunciation]**

**Other Unique Sounds:**
- ჟ [ʒ] - like 's' in 'measure'
- ღ [ɣ] - guttural fricative, like Spanish 'g' in 'lago'
- ხ [x] - guttural fricative, like German 'ch' in 'Bach'
- შ [ʃ] - like 'sh' in 'shoe'
- ც [ts] - like 'ts' in 'cats'
- ძ [dz] - like 'dz' in 'adze'
- ჯ [dʒ] - like 'j' in 'judge'

**[Show IPA symbols and mouth diagrams for each]**

### Practice Exercise 1: Letter Recognition (30:00 - 37:00)
**[Interactive letter matching game]**

"Now, let's practice! On your screen, you'll see Georgian letters appear. Try to identify which sound they make. Don't worry if you make mistakes - that's part of learning!

**[Show letters one by one, pause for student response]**

- What sound does ა make? [a]
- What sound does კ make? [kʼ] - remember, it's an ejective!
- What sound does თ make? [tʰ] - aspirated!

Great job! Keep practicing these at your own pace."

### Summary (37:00 - 42:00)
**[Review all 33 letters]**

"Let's review what we learned today:

1. Georgian uses the Mkhedruli alphabet with 33 letters
2. There are no uppercase or lowercase letters - one form for each letter
3. We have 5 vowels: ა, ე, ი, ო, უ
4. We have 28 consonants, including unique sounds like ejectives and gutturals
5. Ejective consonants are made with a glottal closure - practice these!

The key to mastering the alphabet is repetition. Write each letter, say each sound, and be patient with yourself."

### Assignment (42:00 - 45:00)
**[Practice exercises]**

"Before the next lesson, please:

1. **Write each letter 10 times** - Practice the handwriting worksheets I've provided
2. **Practice pronunciation** - Listen to the audio files and repeat each letter sound
3. **Flashcards** - Create flashcards with the Georgian letter on one side and the sound on the other
4. **Identify letters** - Try to find Georgian text online and identify which letters you recognize

Don't worry about memorizing everything perfectly - we'll keep practicing in future lessons. The goal is familiarity, not perfection!
