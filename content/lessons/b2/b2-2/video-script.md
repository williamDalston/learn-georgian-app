### Opening (0:00 - 0:45)
**[Instructor greeting]**

"Gamarjoba! Welcome back! In our last lesson, we explored the concept of split-ergativity and learned how Georgian shifts its case alignment system. Today, we're diving deep into Series II - the Aorist tense - and learning how to actually form these perfective past tense verbs.

Mastering Aorist formation is crucial because this is where the case shift happens. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to form Aorist verbs correctly and understand how perfective stems work with preverbs. This knowledge will unlock the past tense for you in Georgian. Let's get started!"

### Introduction: What is the Aorist? (0:45 - 8:00)
**[Show timeline: Past tenses in Georgian]**

"First, let's understand what the Aorist is. The Aorist is a past tense that views the action as a complete, whole event - that's why it's perfective aspect. Think of it as a snapshot of a completed action, not an ongoing process.

**Key Characteristics of Aorist:**
- It's a **perfective past tense** - the action is completed
- It belongs to **Series II** - triggers Ergative-Absolutive alignment
- It requires **perfective stems** - usually formed with preverbs
- It has its own **polypersonal agreement markers** - tracking both Ergative subject and Nominative object

**Comparison:**
Let's see the difference between present (Series I) and Aorist (Series II):

**[Show comparison]**
Present: მე ვხედავ კატას [me vkhedav kat'as] - 'I see the cat'
- ვხედავ [vkhedav] - imperfective stem, present tense

Aorist: მე ვნახე კატა [me vnakhe kat'a] - 'I saw the cat'
- ვნახე [vnakhe] - perfective stem, Aorist tense

Notice how the verb form completely changes? That's because Aorist uses a different stem - a perfective stem."

### Main Content Section 1: Perfective Stems and Preverbs (8:00 - 28:00)
**[Show verb root + preverb formation]**

"The key to forming Aorist is understanding perfective stems. Most Georgian verbs have two stems:
1. **Imperfective stem** - used for Series I (present/future)
2. **Perfective stem** - used for Series II (Aorist) and Series III (Perfect)

**How Perfective Stems Are Formed:**
Perfective stems are usually created by adding a **preverb** to the root. Preverbs are prefixes that can change both aspect and sometimes meaning.

**Common Preverbs:**
- **ა-** [a-] - often adds perfective aspect
- **და-** [da-] - 'completion' or perfective
- **წა-** [ts'a-] - directional 'away' + perfective
- **მო-** [mo-] - directional 'toward' + perfective
- **გა-** [ga-] - perfective aspect
- **შე-** [she-] - perfective aspect

**Example 1: The verb 'to write'**
**[Show formation]**
Root: ჩწერ- [ts'er-] (write)

Imperfective stem: ვწერ [vts'er] - 'I write' (present)
Perfective stem: დავწერ [davts'er-] - root + preverb და-

Aorist: დავწერე [davts'ere] - 'I wrote'

**[Show full conjugation]**
- Present: მე ვწერ წერილს [me vts'er ts'erils] - 'I write a letter'
- Aorist: მე დავწერე წერილი [me davts'ere ts'erili] - 'I wrote a letter'

**Example 2: The verb 'to read'**
Root: იკითხ- [ikit'kh-] (read)

Imperfective: ვკითხულობ [vkit'khulob] - 'I read' (present)
Perfective: წავიკითხ [ts'avikit'kh-] - with preverb წა-

Aorist: წავიკითხე [ts'avikit'khe] or წაიკითხე [ts'aikit'khe] - 'I read'

**[Show more examples]**
Let's see a few more verbs:

**Verb: 'to see'**
- Imperfective: ვხედავ [vkhedav] - 'I see'
- Perfective: ვნახ- [vnak'-] - perfective stem
- Aorist: ვნახე [vnakhe] - 'I saw'

**Verb: 'to teach'**
- Imperfective: ასწავლი [asts'avli] - 'I teach'
- Perfective: ასწავლ- [asts'avl-] - same root, different aspect
- Aorist: ასწავლე [asts'avle] or ავასწავლე [avasts'avle] - 'I taught'

**Important Note:**
Not all verbs form perfective stems the same way. Some verbs:
- Simply change internal vowels
- Use suppletive stems (completely different forms)
- Add preverbs that also change meaning slightly

The key is recognizing that Aorist uses perfective stems, and these usually involve preverbs."

### Main Content Section 2: Aorist Conjugation Patterns (28:00 - 50:00)
**[Show conjugation tables]**

"Now let's learn how to conjugate Aorist verbs. Aorist has its own polypersonal agreement markers that track both the Ergative subject and the Nominative object.

**Transitive Verbs in Aorist:**

For transitive verbs, the agreement markers show:
1. Ergative subject (who did it)
2. Nominative object (what was done to)

**[Show first person singular]**
**First Person Singular:**
- მე დავწერე წერილი [me davts'ere ts'erili] - 'I wrote a letter'
- Marker: და-ვ-წერე [da-v-ts'ere]
  - და- [da-] = preverb (perfective)
  - ვ- [v-] = first person subject marker (Ergative)
  - წერე [ts'ere] = Aorist ending

**[Show second person singular]**
**Second Person Singular:**
- შენ დაწერე წერილი [shen dats'ere ts'erili] - 'You wrote a letter'
- Marker: და-წერე [da-ts'ere] - no subject marker for 2nd person singular

**[Show third person singular]**
**Third Person Singular:**
- მან დაწერა წერილი [man dats'era ts'erili] - 'He/She wrote a letter'
- Marker: და-წერა [da-ts'era]
  - ას- [as-] in some verbs indicates 3rd person + object

**[Show plural forms]**
**First Person Plural:**
- ჩვენ დავწერეთ წერილი [chven davts'eret ts'erili] - 'We wrote a letter'
- Marker: და-ვ-წერეთ [da-v-ts'eret]

**Second Person Plural:**
- თქვენ დაწერეთ წერილი [tkven dats'eret ts'erili] - 'You (plural) wrote a letter'
- Marker: და-წერეთ [da-ts'eret]

**Third Person Plural:**
- მათ დაწერეს წერილი [mat dats'eres ts'erili] - 'They wrote a letter'
- Marker: და-წერეს [da-ts'eres]

**[Show object markers]**
**Object Markers in Aorist:**

When there's an object, Series II uses specific markers:
- **First person object:** მ- [m-] - 'me'
- **Second person object:** გ- [g-] - 'you'
- **Third person object:** ჰ- [h-] or vowel changes - 'him/her/it'

**Example with object markers:**
- მან დამიწერა წერილი [man damits'era ts'erili] - 'He wrote me a letter'
  - და-მ-ი-წერა [da-m-i-ts'era] - მ- [m-] = first person object 'me'

- მან დაგიწერა წერილი [man dagits'era ts'erili] - 'He wrote you a letter'
  - და-გ-ი-წერა [da-g-i-ts'era] - გ- [g-] = second person object 'you'"

---

### Main Content Section 3: Intransitive Verbs in Aorist (50:00 - 60:00)
**[Show intransitive conjugation]**

"Important: Intransitive verbs work differently! They don't show case shift because there's no object to shift.

**Intransitive Verbs:**
- Subjects remain in **Nominative** (not Ergative)
- Conjugation is simpler (no object markers needed)

**[Show examples]**
**Example: 'to run'**
- Present: მე ვირბინე [me virbine] - 'I run'
- Aorist: მე ვირბინე [me virbine] - 'I ran'
  - Same form! But context tells us it's past.

Wait, that looks the same. Let me show you a clearer example:

**Example: 'to go'**
- Present: მე მივდივარ [me mividivar] - 'I go'
- Aorist: მე წავედი [me ts'avedi] - 'I went'

**Example: 'to come'**
- Present: მე მოვდივარ [me movdivar] - 'I come'
- Aorist: მე მოვედი [me movedi] - 'I came'

**Key Point:**
For intransitive verbs in Aorist:
- Subject stays in Nominative case
- No Ergative marking needed
- Verb uses perfective stem (often with preverb)

The case shift (Ergative-Absolutive alignment) only applies to **transitive verbs**."

### Practice Exercise: Forming Aorist Verbs (60:00 - 70:00)
**[Guided practice]**

"Let's practice forming Aorist verbs. I'll give you present tense sentences, and you'll transform them to Aorist.

**Exercise 1:**
Present: მე ვწერ წერილს [me vts'er ts'erils] - 'I write a letter'

To form Aorist:
1. Change verb to perfective stem: ვწერ → დავწერე
2. Subject stays same (but is now Ergative in meaning)
3. Object shifts: წერილს (Dative) → წერილი (Absolutive/Nominative)

Aorist: მე დავწერე წერილი [me davts'ere ts'erili] - 'I wrote a letter'

**Exercise 2:**
Present: ბავშვი კითხულობს წიგნს [bavshvi kit'khulobs ts'igns] - 'The child reads the book'

To form Aorist:
1. Verb: კითხულობს → წაიკითხა (perfective stem with preverb წა-)
2. Subject: ბავშვი → ბავშვმა (add Ergative -მა)
3. Object: წიგნს → წიგნი (Dative to Absolutive)

Aorist: ბავშვმა წაიკითხა წიგნი [bavshvma ts'aikit'kha ts'igni] - 'The child read the book'

**Exercise 3:**
Present: ის ხედავს ფილმს [is khedavs p'ilms] - 'He sees the film'

To form Aorist:
1. Verb: ხედავს → ნახა (perfective stem)
2. Subject: ის → მან (Ergative form)
3. Object: ფილმს → ფილმი (Dative to Absolutive)

Aorist: მან ნახა ფილმი [man nakha p'ilmi] - 'He saw the film'

Try transforming a few more on your own, focusing on:
1. Finding the perfective stem (usually with preverb)
2. Adding Ergative marking to transitive subjects
3. Shifting objects from Dative to Absolutive/Nominative"

### Summary (70:00 - 73:00)
**[Review key points]**

"Let's review what we've learned about Series II Aorist:

1. **Aorist is a Perfective Past Tense:**
   - Views action as complete, whole event
   - Belongs to Series II
   - Triggers Ergative-Absolutive alignment

2. **Perfective Stems:**
   - Usually formed with preverbs (ა-, და-, წა-, მო-, გა-, შე-)
   - Different from imperfective stems used in Series I
   - May involve vowel changes or suppletive forms

3. **Aorist Conjugation:**
   - Has special polypersonal agreement markers
   - Tracks both Ergative subject and Nominative object
   - Uses different markers than Series I

4. **Case Marking:**
   - Transitive subjects: Ergative (often with -მა suffix)
   - Transitive objects: Absolutive/Nominative (no Dative marker)
   - Intransitive subjects: Stay in Nominative (no change)

5. **Preverbs:**
   - Add perfective aspect
   - Sometimes change meaning slightly
   - Essential for forming Aorist

Master these patterns, and you'll be able to form past tense verbs correctly!"
