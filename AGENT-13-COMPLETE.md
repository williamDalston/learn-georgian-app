# Agent 13: Enhanced Phonics & Phonology Foundation - COMPLETE ✅

**Date Completed:** January 2025  
**Agent:** Agent 13  
**Status:** 100% COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Agent 13 has successfully restructured the A1 learning path with a **sound-first approach** that prioritizes pronunciation mastery before vocabulary acquisition. This critical pedagogical improvement prevents pronunciation fossilization and ensures learners develop correct habits from the start.
