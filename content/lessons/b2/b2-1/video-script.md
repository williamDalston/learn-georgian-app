### Opening (0:00 - 0:45)
**[Instructor greeting with excitement]**

"Gamarjoba! Welcome to B2 level - this is where Georgian grammar becomes truly fascinating and where you'll master one of the language's most distinctive features: split-ergativity. 

Today, we're going to explore something that makes Georgian unique among European languages - the fact that Georgian actually changes its entire grammatical alignment system depending on tense and aspect. This is called 'split-ergativity,' and it's one of the most challenging but rewarding aspects of Georgian grammar.

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand why the same sentence can have completely different case markings depending on whether it's in the present or past tense. This knowledge will transform how you understand and use Georgian. Let's begin!"

### Introduction: What is Split-Ergativity? (0:45 - 8:00)
**[Show comparison slides: English vs Georgian alignment]**

"Before we dive into Georgian, let's understand what 'alignment' means in linguistics. In any language, we need to mark the relationships between words in a sentence - who does what to whom.

**Nominative-Accusative Alignment (Like English):**
Most languages you know use what's called 'Nominative-Accusative' alignment:
- The subject (doer) is always marked the same way, whether the verb is transitive (has an object) or intransitive (no object)
- The object is marked differently

**[Show example]**
English:
- 'I run' (intransitive - I is subject)
- 'I see the cat' (transitive - I is subject, cat is object)

In both cases, 'I' is the subject and looks the same.

**Ergative-Absolutive Alignment:**
Some languages use 'Ergative-Absolutive' alignment:
- The subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb are marked the same way (called 'Absolutive')
- The subject of a transitive verb is marked differently (called 'Ergative')

**[Show example with Georgian]**
Georgian in the PAST:
- მე ვირბინე [me virbine] - 'I ran' (intransitive - მე is Absolutive)
- კატა ვნახე [kat'a vnakhe] - 'I saw the cat' (transitive - კატა is Absolutive, მე would be Ergative)

Notice how 'I' (the subject) in the first sentence and 'cat' (the object) in the second are marked the same way - that's Ergative-Absolutive alignment!

**Georgian's Split:**
Here's what makes Georgian special: it uses BOTH systems!
- **Series I (Present/Future):** Uses Nominative-Accusative alignment
- **Series II (Aorist/Past):** Uses Ergative-Absolutive alignment for transitive verbs
- **Series III (Perfect):** Uses Ergative-Absolutive alignment

This 'split' based on tense and aspect is why we call it 'split-ergativity.'"

### Main Content Section 1: The Case Shift in Action (8:00 - 25:00)
**[Show side-by-side examples: Present vs Past]**

"Let's see this case shift in action with real examples. I'll show you the same sentence in present and past tense, and you'll see how the case markings completely change.

**Example 1: The Subject Marking Shift**

Present Tense (Series I - Nominative-Accusative):
**[Show on screen]**
მე ვხედავ კატას [me vkhedav kat'as]
- მე [me] - 'I' (subject, Nominative)
- ვხედავ [vkhedav] - 'I see' (verb)
- კატას [kat'as] - 'the cat' (object, Dative case)

Past Tense (Series II - Ergative-Absolutive):
**[Show on screen]**
მე ვნახე კატა [me vnakhe kat'a]
- მე [me] - 'I' (subject, now Ergative - but still looks like მე)
- ვნახე [vnakhe] - 'I saw' (verb, Aorist)
- კატა [kat'a] - 'the cat' (object, now Absolutive/Nominative)

Did you notice? In the past tense, 'the cat' changed from Dative (კატას) to Nominative (კატა)! The subject 'I' stayed the same in form, but its grammatical role changed from Nominative to Ergative.

**Example 2: More Complex Case Shift**

Present Tense:
**[Show on screen]**
მასწავლებელი ასწავლის სტუდენტებს [masts'avlebeli asts'avlis st'udent'ebs]
- მასწავლებელი [masts'avlebeli] - 'the teacher' (subject, Nominative)
- ასწავლის [asts'avlis] - 'teaches' (verb)
- სტუდენტებს [st'udent'ebs] - 'students' (object, Dative plural)

Past Tense:
**[Show on screen]**
მასწავლებელმა ასწავლა სტუდენტები [masts'avlebelma asts'avla st'udent'ebi]
- მასწავლებელმა [masts'avlebelma] - 'the teacher' (subject, now Ergative with -მა suffix)
- ასწავლა [asts'avla] - 'taught' (verb, Aorist)
- სტუდენტები [st'udent'ebi] - 'students' (object, now Absolutive/Nominative plural)

This is the key pattern: in transitive past tense sentences, the subject gets Ergative marking (often -მა), and the object shifts to Nominative/Absolutive case!"

### Main Content Section 2: Why Does This Happen? TAM Features (25:00 - 40:00)
**[Show diagram: TAM → Alignment]**

"So why does Georgian do this? The answer lies in Tense-Aspect-Mood features, or TAM.

**Understanding TAM:**
- **Tense:** When the action happens (present, past, future)
- **Aspect:** How the action unfolds (perfective, imperfective)
- **Mood:** The speaker's attitude (indicative, subjunctive, imperative)

Georgian organizes its verbs into three 'Series' based on TAM:

**Series I: Present and Future (Imperfective Aspect)**
- Uses Nominative-Accusative alignment
- Present tense: ვხედავ [vkhedav] - 'I see'
- Future tense: ვნახავ [vnakhav] - 'I will see'
- Subject: Nominative
- Object: Dative

**Series II: Aorist (Perfective Past)**
- Uses Ergative-Absolutive alignment for transitive verbs
- Aorist tense: ვნახე [vnakhe] - 'I saw'
- Subject: Ergative (marked with -მა for many nouns)
- Object: Nominative/Absolutive

**Series III: Perfect and Pluperfect (Perfective Aspect)**
- Uses Ergative-Absolutive alignment for transitive verbs
- Perfect tense: ვნახვია [vnakhvia] - 'I have seen'
- Subject: Ergative
- Object: Nominative/Absolutive

**The Pattern:**
**[Show summary table]**
- Imperfective aspect (ongoing, habitual) → Nominative-Accusative
- Perfective aspect (completed, whole action) → Ergative-Absolutive

This isn't arbitrary - it's a systematic feature of Georgian that connects aspect to case alignment."

### Main Content Section 3: Recognizing the Shift (40:00 - 55:00)
**[Interactive recognition exercises]**

"Now let's practice recognizing when the case shift occurs. Here's what to look for:

**Clue 1: Verb Form**
The verb form tells you which series you're in:
- Present/Future verbs → Series I → Nominative-Accusative
- Aorist verbs (usually ending in -ე, -ა, etc.) → Series II → Ergative-Absolutive
- Perfect verbs (ending in -ია, -აო) → Series III → Ergative-Absolutive

**Clue 2: Subject Marking**
- Nominative subjects (Series I): No special case marker, just the base form
- Ergative subjects (Series II/III): Often marked with -მა suffix, or special agreement markers

**Clue 3: Object Marking**
- Dative objects (Series I): End in -ს or -თ
- Absolutive objects (Series II/III): Nominative form, no Dative marker

**Practice Recognition:**
Let's analyze these sentences together:

**[Show sentence 1]**
Sentence 1: ბავშვი კითხულობს წიგნს [bavshvi kit'khulobs ts'igns]
- Verb: კითხულობს [kit'khulobs] - present tense
- Subject: ბავშვი [bavshvi] - Nominative (no case marker)
- Object: წიგნს [ts'igns] - Dative (ends in -ს)
- **Alignment:** Nominative-Accusative (Series I)

**[Show sentence 2]**
Sentence 2: ბავშვმა წაიკითხა წიგნი [bavshvma ts'aikit'kha ts'igni]
- Verb: წაიკითხა [ts'aikit'kha] - Aorist (past perfective)
- Subject: ბავშვმა [bavshvma] - Ergative (ends in -მა)
- Object: წიგნი [ts'igni] - Absolutive/Nominative (no Dative marker)
- **Alignment:** Ergative-Absolutive (Series II)

See the shift? Same meaning ('The child reads/read the book'), but completely different case marking!"

### Practice Exercise: Case Shift Transformation (55:00 - 63:00)
**[Guided practice]**

"Let's transform sentences from present to past tense, paying attention to the case shift:

**Exercise 1:**
Present: მე ვწერ წერილს [me vts'er ts'erils] - 'I write a letter'
Transform to past tense:
- Verb: ვწერ [vts'er] → წავწერე [ts'avts'ere] or დავწერე [davts'ere] 'I wrote'
- Subject: მე [me] stays the same but is now Ergative
- Object: წერილს [ts'erils] (Dative) → წერილი [ts'erili] (Absolutive/Nominative)

Past: მე დავწერე წერილი [me davts'ere ts'erili] - 'I wrote a letter'

**Exercise 2:**
Present: ის წაიკითხავს წიგნს [is ts'aikit'khavs ts'igns] - 'He will read the book'
Transform to past tense:
- Verb: წაიკითხავს [ts'aikit'khavs] → წაიკითხა [ts'aikit'kha] 'he read'
- Subject: ის [is] stays the same but is now Ergative
- Object: წიგნს [ts'igns] (Dative) → წიგნი [ts'igni] (Absolutive/Nominative)

Past: მან წაიკითხა წიგნი [man ts'aikit'kha ts'igni] - 'He read the book' (Note: subject might become მან in Ergative)

Try a few more transformations on your own, focusing on how the object shifts from Dative to Nominative."

### Summary (63:00 - 68:00)
**[Review key points]**

"Let's review what we've learned about split-ergativity:

1. **Two Alignment Systems:**
   - Nominative-Accusative: Used in Series I (Present/Future)
   - Ergative-Absolutive: Used in Series II (Aorist) and Series III (Perfect)

2. **The Case Shift:**
   - In transitive past tense sentences, the subject becomes Ergative (often marked with -მა)
   - The object shifts from Dative to Nominative/Absolutive

3. **Why It Happens:**
   - Connected to Tense-Aspect-Mood features
   - Imperfective aspect → Nominative-Accusative
   - Perfective aspect → Ergative-Absolutive

4. **How to Recognize:**
   - Look at the verb form (present vs. aorist vs. perfect)
   - Check subject marking (-მა suffix indicates Ergative)
   - Check object marking (Dative vs. Nominative)

This case shift is systematic and follows clear rules. Once you understand the pattern, you can predict how any transitive sentence will change when shifted between tenses!"

### Assignment (68:00 - 70:00)
**[Homework instructions]**

"Before the next lesson, please:

1. **Transform 5 present tense transitive sentences to past tense**, paying close attention to:
   - How the subject marking changes (Ergative)
   - How the object marking changes (Dative → Nominative)
   - How the verb form changes (Aorist)

2. **Identify the alignment system** in 10 sentences (5 present, 5 past):
   - Mark which are Nominative-Accusative
   - Mark which are Ergative-Absolutive
   - Explain why based on verb form

3. **Create your own examples:**
   - Write 3 sentences in present tense (transitive)
   - Transform them to past tense
   - Highlight the case shift in each

4. **Review the concept:**
   - Read back through the key differences between the two alignment systems
   - Practice identifying Series I vs. Series II verbs

In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into Series II (Aorist) formation and the specific conjugation patterns. Understanding split-ergativity is the foundation for everything that comes next!

See you in the next lesson! Nakhvamdis!"
