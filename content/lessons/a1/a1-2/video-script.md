## Video Script

### Opening (0:00 - 0:45)
**[Instructor greeting with focus on pronunciation]**

"Gamarjoba! Welcome back! In our last lesson, we learned all 33 letters of the Mkhedruli alphabet. Today, we're going to learn one of the most important - but also challenging - parts of Georgian pronunciation: the three different ways to make consonant sounds.

Georgian has three types of consonant sounds: voiced, aspirated, and ejective. Learning these differences now is important for your pronunciation. But don't worry - by the end of this lesson, you'll understand exactly how to make each type correctly.

Let's begin!"

### Introduction: The Three-Way Distinction (0:45 - 5:00)
**[Visual diagram showing three types of stops]**

"You might think that 'b' and 'p' are just different letters, right? In Georgian, it's more interesting. We have three ways to make consonant sounds:

**1. Voiced Sounds:** Made with your throat vibrating. Examples: ბ [b], გ [g], დ [d]
**2. Aspirated Sounds:** Made with a puff of air. Examples: თ [tʰ], ფ [pʰ], ქ [kʰ]
**3. Ejective Sounds:** Made by closing your throat and making a 'pop' sound. Examples: კ [kʼ], პ [pʼ], ტ [tʼ]

**[Show diagram with mouth positions and airflow]**

The important thing is that Georgian uses ALL THREE of these for similar sounds. For example, we have:
- ქ [kʰ] - 'k' with air
- კ [kʼ] - 'k' with a pop
- გ [g] - 'g' with vibration

These are THREE DIFFERENT SOUNDS to Georgian speakers. Even though they might sound similar to English speakers at first, you need to learn to hear and make the difference."

---

### Section 1: Voiced Sounds (5:00 - 15:00)
**[Focus on voiced consonants]**

"Let's start with voiced sounds. These are probably the easiest for English speakers because English also has voiced consonants.

**Voiced Consonants:**
- ბ [b] - like English 'b' in 'bat'
- გ [g] - like English 'g' in 'go'
- დ [d] - like English 'd' in 'dog'

**[Demonstrate each with hand on throat to show vibration]**

Try this: put your hand on your throat and say 'ბ' [b]. Feel that vibration? That's your throat vibrating. This is a voiced sound.

**[Practice words with voiced stops]**
- ბაგა (bag-a) - 'bag'
- გარე (gare) - 'outside'
- დიდი (didi) - 'big'

Practice saying these words and feel the vibration in your throat."

---

### Section 2: Aspirated Sounds (15:00 - 30:00)
**[Focus on aspirated consonants]**

"Now for aspirated sounds. These are made with a strong puff of air. In English, we sometimes have this, but Georgian makes it stronger and clearer.

**Aspirated Consonants:**
- თ [tʰ] - 't' with air, like 't' in 'top' but with more air
- ფ [pʰ] - 'p' with air, like 'p' in 'pin' but with more air
- ქ [kʰ] - 'k' with air, like 'k' in 'kite' but with more air

**[Demonstrate with paper in front of mouth - paper should move]**

Here's a trick: Hold a piece of paper in front of your mouth. When you say an aspirated consonant, the paper should move! Try it:
- თხა (t'xa) - 'goat' - paper should move
- ფული (puli) - 'money' - paper should move
- ქალაქი (kalaki) - 'city' - paper should move

**[Show IPA symbol [ʰ] and explain]**

The little 'h' in [tʰ] represents the aspiration - the puff of air. This is what distinguishes aspirated stops from ejective stops."

---

### Section 3: Ejective Sounds - The Challenge (30:00 - 50:00)
**[Deep dive into ejective consonants]**

"Now for the challenging part: ejective sounds. These don't exist in English, so they'll feel completely new.

**Ejective Consonants:**
- კ [kʼ] - ejective 'k'
- პ [pʼ] - ejective 'p'
- ტ [tʼ] - ejective 't'
- წ [tsʼ] - ejective 'ts'
- ჭ [tʃʼ] - ejective 'ch'
- ყ [qʼ] - ejective 'q'

**[Slow-motion demonstration with throat diagram]**

Here's how to make an ejective:

1. **Close your throat** (the space between your vocal cords) - like you're holding your breath
2. **Build up pressure** in your mouth
3. **Release with a 'pop'** sound

**[Visual: Slow-motion animation of throat closure]**

Try this step by step:
- Close your throat - you should feel pressure
- Now try to say 'k' BUT keep your throat closed
- Release with a pop: კ [kʼ]

**[Practice words with ejectives]**
- კაცი (k'ats-i) - 'man' - notice the pop on კ
- პაპა (p'ap'a) - 'grandfather' - pop on პ
- ტბა (t'ba) - 'lake' - pop on ტ
- წყალი (ts'q'ali) - 'water' - pops on წ and ყ

**[Troubleshooting tips]**

If you're struggling:
1. Feel your throat - it should feel constricted before the pop
2. The sound should be sharp and crisp, not breathy
3. Practice in front of a mirror to see your throat move
4. Compare: თ [tʰ] (breathy) vs ტ [tʼ] (sharp pop)"

---

### Section 4: Comparison and Contrast (50:00 - 55:00)
**[Side-by-side comparison]**

"Let's compare these sounds side by side:

**The 'T' Trio:**
- თ [tʰ] - Aspirated: breathy, with air puff
- ტ [tʼ] - Ejective: sharp, with throat pop
- დ [d] - Voiced: vibrating throat

**[Audio comparison - play each sound three times]**

Listen carefully:
- თ [tʰ] თ [tʰ] თ [tʰ] - hear the air?
- ტ [tʼ] ტ [tʼ] ტ [tʼ] - hear the pop?
- დ [d] დ [d] დ [d] - feel the vibration?

**[Practice minimal pairs]**
- თხა [tʰxa] (goat) vs ტბა [tʼba] (lake)
- კაცი [kʼatsi] (man) vs ქალაქი [kʰalakʰi] (city)

**[Common mistakes to avoid]**

English speakers often:
- ❌ Make ejectives too breathy (confusing with aspirated)
- ❌ Make aspirated too weak (missing the air puff)
- ❌ Forget to close glottis for ejectives

The key: ejectives should feel like a 'pop' in your throat, not air coming out of your mouth."

### Practice Exercise: Pronunciation Drills (55:00 - 58:00)
**[Interactive practice]**

"Now let's practice! I'll say a word, and you try to identify which type of stop consonant you hear:

1. ბაგა (bag-a) - What type? [Voiced - ბ]
2. თხა (t'xa) - What type? [Aspirated - თ]
3. კაცი (k'ats-i) - What type? [Ejective - კ]

**[Practice production]**

Now you try! Repeat after me:
- ბ [b] - voiced
- თ [tʰ] - aspirated  
- ტ [tʼ] - ejective

Keep practicing - this takes time!"

---

### Summary (58:00 - 60:00)
**[Review key points]**

"Let's review what we learned today:

1. **Voiced sounds** [b, g, d]: Throat vibrates
2. **Aspirated sounds** [tʰ, pʰ, kʰ]: Made with puff of air
3. **Ejective sounds** [kʼ, pʼ, tʼ]: Made by closing throat and popping

This three-way difference is one of Georgian's unique features. Master this, and you're well on your way to good pronunciation!

**Key practice tip:** Spend at least 15 minutes daily practicing ejective consonants. Use the audio files I've provided and record yourself to compare."

---

### Assignment (60:00)
**[Homework]**

"Before the next lesson:

1. **Daily ejective practice** - 15 minutes minimum
   - Use audio files: კ, პ, ტ, წ, ჭ, ყ
   - Record yourself and compare with native audio
   
2. **Minimal pair practice**
   - Practice: თ vs ტ, ქ vs კ, ფ vs პ
   - Use the pronunciation drills worksheet
   
3. **Feel the difference**
   - Put hand on throat for voiced
   - Use paper test for aspirated
   - Practice glottal closure for ejective

4. **Watch tutorial videos** (optional)
   - Search 'Georgian ejective consonants' on YouTube
   - Watch native speakers' mouth movements

Remember: Pronunciation fossilization is real - practice correctly now, or you'll struggle later!

Nakhvamdis! See you in the next lesson!"
