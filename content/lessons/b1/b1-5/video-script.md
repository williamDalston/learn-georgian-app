### Opening (0:00 - 0:30)
**[Instructor greeting with engaging smile]**

"Gamarjoba! Welcome back to B1 level. We've been mastering Class I transitive verbs, but today we're going to explore something completely different - and it's going to challenge everything you know about Georgian grammar! Today we're learning Class IV verbs, also called 'Indirect Verbs.' These are the verbs that express emotions, perceptions, and mental states. Get ready for a grammatical adventure!"

### Introduction (0:30 - 5:00)
**[Show comparison: Class I vs Class IV on screen]**

"Up until now, you've learned Class I verbs like ვხედავ [vkhedav] - 'I see.' In these verbs, the subject does something to an object. The subject is in Nominative case, the object in Dative case.

But Georgian has a special class of verbs where this pattern is completely reversed! These are Class IV verbs, and they express things like wanting, knowing, liking, and feeling.

Let me show you the difference:

**Class I (Transitive):** მე ვხედავ კატას [me vkhedav kat'as]
- მე [me] = I (Nominative - subject doing the action)
- კატას [kat'as] = cat (Dative - object receiving the action)
- 'I see the cat'

**Class IV (Indirect):** მე მინდა წიგნი [me minda ts'igni]
- მე [me] = I (Dative - experiencer!)
- წიგნი [ts'igni] = book (Nominative - the thing!)
- 'I want the book'

**[Display dramatic visual highlighting the case switch]**

Did you notice? In Class IV verbs, the person who wants/knows/likes takes Dative case, not Nominative! And the thing they want/know/like takes Nominative case, not Dative!

This is called **Dative-Nominative alignment**, and it's one of the most distinctive features of Georgian grammar. By the end of this lesson, you'll master it!"

### Main Content Section 1: Understanding Class IV Verbs (5:00 - 20:00)
**[Display verb class comparison chart]**

"Let's understand why Class IV verbs are special. In linguistics, Class IV verbs are called 'psych verbs' or 'experience verbs' because they describe psychological or emotional states.

The key difference is in who controls the action:
- **Class I verbs:** The subject actively does something (I see, I eat, I write)
- **Class IV verbs:** The subject experiences something (I want, I know, I like)

In Class IV verbs, the experiencer (the person feeling/thinking) takes Dative case, and the theme (the thing being experienced) takes Nominative case.

**[Show sentence structure breakdown]**

Let's look at the verb 'to want' - უნდა [unda]:

**Present Tense - 'I want':**
- მე მინდა წიგნი [me minda ts'igni] - I want the book
  - მე [me] = I (Dative)
  - მინდა [minda] = want (1st person singular)
  - წიგნი [ts'igni] = book (Nominative)

**'You want' (informal):**
- შენ გინდა წიგნი [shen ginda ts'igni] - You want the book
  - შენ [shen] = you (Dative)
  - გინდა [ginda] = want (2nd person singular)

**'He/She wants':**
- მას უნდა წიგნი [mas unda ts'igni] - He/She wants the book
  - მას [mas] = he/she (Dative)
  - უნდა [unda] = want (3rd person)

**[Show conjugation table on screen]**

Notice how the verb ending changes, but the case structure always remains: experiencer in Dative, theme in Nominative!"

### Main Content Section 2: The Verb 'To Know' - ცოდნა (20:00 - 32:00)
**[Display verb 'to know' conjugation]**

"Let's learn another essential Class IV verb: ცოდნა [tsodna] - 'to know.'

This verb is crucial for expressing knowledge. Let's see how it works:

**Present Tense Conjugation:**

მე ვიცი [me vitsi] - I know
- მე [me] = I (Dative implied, can be omitted)
- ვიცი [vitsi] = I know (1st person singular)

შენ იცი [shen itsi] - You know
- შენ [shen] = you (Dative implied)
- იცი [itsi] = you know (2nd person singular)

მას იცის [mas itsis] - He/She knows
- მას [mas] = he/she (Dative)
- იცის [itsis] = knows (3rd person)

**[Show example sentences]**

Now, let's use it in sentences:

მე ვიცი ეს სიტყვა [me vitsi es sit'q'va] - I know this word
- ეს სიტყვა [es sit'q'va] = this word (Nominative)

შენ იცი ქართული? [shen itsi kartuli?] - Do you know Georgian?
- ქართული [kartuli] = Georgian (Nominative)

მას იცის სახელი [mas itsis sakheli] - He/She knows the name
- სახელი [sakheli] = name (Nominative)

**[Practice exercise embedded]**

Let's practice! I'll give you the subject and object, and you form the sentence:

Example: I (want) / book
Answer: მე მინდა წიგნი [me minda ts'igni]

Now you try:
1. You (know) / Georgian
2. He (wants) / water
3. I (know) / answer"

### Main Content Section 3: The Verb 'To Like' - მოწონება (32:00 - 42:00)
**[Display verb 'to like' structure]**

"Another essential Class IV verb is მოწონება [mots'oneba] - 'to like' or 'to please.'

This verb works the same way - experiencer in Dative, thing liked in Nominative:

**Conjugation:**

მე მომწონს [me momts'ons] - I like / It pleases me
- მე [me] = to me (Dative)

შენ მოგწონს [shen mogts'ons] - You like / It pleases you
- შენ [shen] = to you (Dative)

მას მოსწონს [mas mosts'ons] - He/She likes / It pleases him/her
- მას [mas] = to him/her (Dative)

**[Show examples]**

მე მომწონს ეს ფილმი [me momts'ons es pilmi] - I like this film
- ეს ფილმი [es pilmi] = this film (Nominative)

შენ მოგწონს ქართული მუსიკა? [shen mogts'ons kartuli musika?] - Do you like Georgian music?
- ქართული მუსიკა [kartuli musika] = Georgian music (Nominative)

მას მოსწონს წიგნები [mas mosts'ons ts'ignebi] - He/She likes books
- წიგნები [ts'ignebi] = books (Nominative plural)

**[Highlight cultural note]**

Notice how Georgian expresses 'liking' differently from English. In English we say 'I like X,' but in Georgian it's more like 'X pleases me' - მომწონს [momts'ons]. This reflects the experiencer structure!"

### Main Content Section 4: The Verb 'To Study/Learn' - სწავლა (42:00 - 50:00)
**[Display verb 'to study']**

"Let's learn one more Class IV verb: სწავლა [sts'avla] - 'to study' or 'to learn.'

This verb follows the same pattern:

**Conjugation:**

მე ვსწავლობ [me vsts'avlob] - I study/learn
შენ სწავლობ [shen sts'avlob] - You study/learn
მას სწავლობს [mas sts'avlobs] - He/She studies/learns

**[Show example sentences]**

მე ვსწავლობ ქართულს [me vsts'avlob kartuls] - I study Georgian
- ქართულს [kartuls] = Georgian (Wait... this is Dative!)

**[Pause for emphasis]**

Actually, notice something interesting here! With 'სწავლობ' [sts'avlob], the thing being studied often takes Dative case, not Nominative. This is because studying implies an indirect relationship.

**[Show more examples]**

მე ვსწავლობ ისტორიას [me vsts'avlob ist'orias] - I study history
შენ სწავლობ მათემატიკას [shen sts'avlob matemat'ik'as] - You study mathematics

**[Note about variation]**

Some Class IV verbs can vary in their case marking depending on the specific verb. 'სწავლობ' [sts'avlob] is flexible - you might also hear it with Nominative in some contexts."

### Practice Exercise 1: Sentence Formation (50:00 - 52:00)
**[Interactive practice]**

"Let's practice! I'll give you the components, and you form the sentence:

1. I / want / apple
   Answer: მე მინდა ვაშლი [me minda vashli]

2. You (informal) / know / answer
   Answer: შენ იცი პასუხი [shen itsi p'asukhi]

3. He / likes / music
   Answer: მას მოსწონს მუსიკა [mas mosts'ons musika]

4. I / study / Georgian
   Answer: მე ვსწავლობ ქართულს [me vsts'avlob kartuls]

Great job! Notice how in each case, the experiencer (the person) appears in its Dative form, even though it's the 'subject' of the English translation."

### Summary (52:00 - 55:00)
**[Display key points on screen]**

"Let's review what we learned today:

**Key Points:**

1. **Class IV verbs** express emotions, perceptions, and mental states
   - To want (უნდა), to know (ცოდნა), to like (მოწონება), to study (სწავლა)

2. **Dative-Nominative alignment:**
   - The experiencer (person feeling/thinking) takes **Dative case**
   - The theme (thing experienced) takes **Nominative case**

3. **This is opposite to Class I verbs:**
   - Class I: Subject (Nominative) → Object (Dative)
   - Class IV: Experiencer (Dative) → Theme (Nominative)

4. **Common Class IV verbs:**
   - მინდა [minda] - I want
   - ვიცი [vitsi] - I know
   - მომწონს [momts'ons] - I like
   - ვსწავლობ [vsts'avlob] - I study

Remember: In Class IV verbs, the person experiencing the emotion or perception is marked with Dative case, even though they appear first in the sentence!"
