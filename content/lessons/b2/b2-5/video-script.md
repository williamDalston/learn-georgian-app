## Video Script

### Opening (0:00 - 0:30)
**[Instructor greeting with confidence]**

"Gamarjoba! Welcome to Series III - this is one of the most elegant and expressive parts of Georgian grammar. By now, you've mastered Series I for present and future, and Series II (Aorist) for simple past. Today, we're learning about **perfect aspect** - how to talk about actions that are completed but still relevant, or actions that happened before other past events. This will give you even more precision in expressing time relationships!"

---

### Introduction (0:30 - 5:00)
**[Show timeline comparison]**

"In English, we have three ways to talk about the past:
1. Simple past: 'I saw a movie' 
2. Present perfect: 'I have seen a movie' (completed but relevant now)
3. Past perfect: 'I had seen a movie' (before another past event)

Georgian has something similar! Let me show you:

**[Display Georgian timeline]**

- **Present:** ვხედავ [vkhedav] - I see
- **Future/Present:** ვნახავ [vnakhav] - I will see / I see
- **Aorist (Series II):** ვნახე [vnakhe] - I saw (simple past)
- **Perfect (Series III):** ვნახიყავ [vnakhik'av] - I have seen (completed but relevant)
- **Pluperfect (Series III):** ვნახედმიყავ [vnakhedmik'av] - I had seen

The Perfect and Pluperfect belong to **Series III**, and they're formed differently from Series I and II!"

**[Clear board]**

### Main Content Section 1: Perfect Aspect Explained (5:00 - 20:00)
**[Display aspect comparison chart]**

"The key difference is **aspect**, not just tense. Let me explain:

**Aspect** tells us HOW an action relates to time:
- **Perfective:** The action as a completed whole (Aorist)
- **Imperfective:** The action as ongoing (Present)
- **Perfect:** The action as completed but still relevant (Series III)

**[Show examples]**

Example 1: Aorist vs Perfect

Aorist: ვნახე ფილმი [vnakhe p'ilmi]
- 'I saw the movie' (simple past, just stating a fact)

Perfect: ვნახიყავ ფილმი [vnakhik'av p'ilmi]
- 'I have seen the movie' (it's in my experience, relevant now - maybe you're asking if I want to see it again?)

**[Emphasize the difference]**

The Perfect focuses on the **result** or **experience** of the action, not just when it happened!

**[Display more examples]**

Example 2:
- Aorist: დავწერე წიგნი [davts'ere ts'igni] - 'I wrote a book' (past event)
- Perfect: დავწერიყავ წიგნი [davts'erik'av ts'igni] - 'I have written a book' (I am a book author now, this is my experience)

Example 3:
- Aorist: ვსწავლობდი [vsts'avlobdi] - 'I was studying' (ongoing in past)
- Perfect: ვსწავლებულვარ [vsts'avlebulyar] - 'I have studied' (I've completed studying, I have this knowledge now)

**[Clear and show structure]**

Now, how do we form these perfect screeves? Let me show you the structure!"

### Main Content Section 2: Series III Structure (20:00 - 35:00)
**[Display verb structure breakdown]**

"Series III has a unique structure compared to Series I and II. It uses an **auxiliary verb** + **main verb combination**.

**[Show formula]**

**Perfect Structure:**
Main Verb (Series I present stem) + Auxiliary Verb (Present of 'to be')

**Pluperfect Structure:**
Main Verb (Series I present stem) + Auxiliary Verb (Imperfect of 'to be')

**[Display example breakdown]**

Let's take the verb ხედვა [khedva] - to see:

**Perfect:** ვნახიყავ [vnakhik'av] - I have seen
- **ნახ** [nakh] = see (root with perfect stem)
- **-იყავ** [-ik'av] = auxiliary verb marker
- The auxiliary is derived from the verb 'to be' (იყო [ik'o])

**[Display full conjugation]**

Let me show you the full Perfect conjugation:

**Perfect Tense - ხედვა [khedva] (to see)**

| Person | Georgian | Transliteration | Translation |
|--------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| I have seen | ვნახიყავ | vnakhik'av | I have seen |
| You have seen (informal) | ნახიყავ | nakhik'av | You have seen |
| He/She/It has seen | ნახიყვის | nakhik'vis | He/She/It has seen |
| We have seen | ვნახიყავთ | vnakhik'avt | We have seen |
| You have seen (plural/formal) | ნახიყავთ | nakhik'avt | You have seen |
| They have seen | ნახიყვან | nakhik'van | They have seen |

**[Highlight key elements]**

Notice:
1. The main verb uses a different stem (ნახ [nakh] instead of ხედავ [khedav])
2. The auxiliary ending varies: -იყავ [-ik'av], -იყვის [-ik'vis], -იყვან [-ik'van]
3. First person keeps the ვ- [v-] prefix

**[Now show Pluperfect]**

Now for **Pluperfect** (Past Perfect):

**Pluperfect Tense - ხედვა [khedva] (I had seen)**

| Person | Georgian | Transliteration | Translation |
|--------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| I had seen | ვნახედმიყავ | vnakhedmik'av | I had seen |
| You had seen | ნახედმიყავ | nakhedmik'av | You had seen |
| He/She/It had seen | ნახედმიყვის | nakhedmik'vis | He/She/It had seen |
| We had seen | ვნახედმიყავთ | vnakhedmik'avt | We had seen |
| You had seen (plural/formal) | ნახედმიყავთ | nakhedmik'avt | You had seen |
| They had seen | ნახედმიყვან | nakhedmik'van | They had seen |

**[Highlight difference]**

The key difference? The auxiliary verb changes to show it happened **before** another past event!"

### Main Content Section 3: Perfect Stem Formation (35:00 - 50:00)
**[Display stem formation rules]**

"Now, this is important: Series III uses a **special stem** called the 'perfect stem.' Let me show you how to form it:

**[Show Class I verbs]**

**Class I Verbs (Transitive):**
Form: Root + ი [-i] + auxiliary

Example: ხედვა [khedva] - to see
- Present stem: ხედავ [khedav]
- Perfect stem: ნახ [nakh] + ი [-i] = ნახი [nakhi]
- Perfect form: ვნახიყავ [vnakhik'av]

**[Show more Class I examples]**

Let's practice with more Class I verbs:

1. წერა [ts'era] - to write
   - Perfect stem: დაწერ [dats'er] + ი [-i] = დაწერი [dats'eri]
   - I have written: დავწერიყავ [davts'erik'av]

2. კითხვა [k'ithva] - to read
   - Perfect stem: წაიკითხ [ts'aik'ith] + ი [-i] = წაიკითხი [ts'aik'ithi]
   - He has read: წაიკითხიყვის [ts'aik'ithik'vis]

**[Now show Class II]**

**Class II Verbs (Intransitive):**
These follow similar patterns but with intransitive roots:

Example: მუშაობა [mushaoba] - to work
- Present: ვმუშაობ [vmushaob]
- Perfect stem: იმუშავ [imushav] + ი [-i] = იმუშავი [imushavi]
- I have worked: ვიმუშავიყავ [vimushavik'av]

Example: დგომა [dgoma] - to stand
- Present: ვდგავარ [vdgavar]
- Perfect: ვდგედმიყავ [vdgedmik'av] - 'I had stood'

**[Show Class IV]**

**Class IV Verbs (Indirect):**
These have the most complex pattern:

Example: ყველას [khvelas] - to love
- Present: მიყვარხარ [mikhvar'khar] - I love
- Perfect: ვიყვარებულვარ [vikhv'ar'ebulyar] - I have loved

**[Clear and emphasize]**

The pattern isn't always predictable! That's why Series III requires memorization and practice!"

### Main Content Section 4: Usage of Perfect vs Aorist (50:00 - 62:00)
**[Display usage scenarios]**

"When do you use Perfect vs Aorist? Great question! Let me give you clear guidelines:

**[Show scenario 1]**

**Use Perfect when:**
1. The action is completed but still relevant NOW
   - ვნახიყავ ფილმი [vnakhik'av p'ilmi] - 'I have seen the movie' (so don't ask me to see it again)
   - დავწერიყავ წერილი [davts'erik'av ts'erili] - 'I have written the letter' (you can read it now)

2. Talking about life experience (ever/never)
   - ოდესმე იყავით საქართველოში? [odesme ik'avit sakartveloshi?] - 'Have you ever been to Georgia?'
   - არასდროს არ შემიყვარხარ [arasdros ar shemikhv'ar'khar] - 'I have never loved you before' (emotional impact)

3. Actions completed at an unspecified time before now
   - დავუძახებიყავ [davudz'ak'hebik'av] - 'I have called' (didn't need to say when)

**[Show scenario 2]**

**Use Aorist when:**
1. Simple past statement with specific time
   - გუშინ ვნახე ფილმი [gushin vnakhe p'ilmi] - 'Yesterday I saw the movie'
   - კვირაში წავიკითხე წიგნი [kvirashi ts'avik'ithe ts'igni] - 'Last week I read the book'

2. Sequential past events
   - ვიღაცა გაღვიძა, დავეცა, დავიწყე მუშაობა [vigatsa gagvidza, davetsa, davits'qe mushaoba]
   - 'I woke up, got dressed, started working' (chain of events)

**[Show scenario 3]**

**Use Pluperfect when:**
1. One past action happened BEFORE another past action
   - როცა ჩავედი, უკვე გაეშურებილიყავ [rotsa ch'avedi, uk've gaeshurebilik'av]
   - 'When I arrived, he had already left'
   - ვნახედმიყავ ფილმი, როდესაც დავკარგე შენ [vnakhedmik'av p'ilmi, rodesats davk'ar'ge shen]
   - 'I had seen the movie when I lost you' (had seen it before losing you)

**[Clear and summarize]**

Think of it this way:
- **Aorist** = simple past facts
- **Perfect** = past relevance to now
- **Pluperfect** = past before past

This gives you powerful tools to express complex time relationships!"

### Practice Exercise 1: Choosing the Right Tense (62:00 - 67:00)
**[Interactive exercise]**

"Now let's practice! I'll give you scenarios, and you decide: Perfect, Aorist, or Pluperfect?

Scenario 2: Yesterday at 3pm, you did your homework.
- Answer: Aorist - გუშინ სამ საათზე დავწერე საშინაოდრო [gushin sam saatze davts'ere sashinaodro]
