### Opening (0:00 - 1:00)
**[Instructor greeting with thoughtful background]**

"Gamarjoba! Welcome to our final C1 lesson - lesson 8. Today, we're going to explore the most sophisticated aspect of Georgian communication: pragmatics. This is about understanding what people really mean beyond the literal words they say. By mastering pragmatics, you'll finally think like a native Georgian speaker, reading between the lines and catching cultural subtext. This is where true fluency lives. Let's begin!"

### Introduction: What is Pragmatics? (1:00 - 4:00)
**[Show contrasting examples of literal vs implied meaning]**

"When someone says 'ნახვამდის' (*nakhvamdis* - goodbye), they literally mean 'see you later,' but pragmatically, this can communicate:
- Warm sincerity in one context
- Polite dismissal in another
- Genuine sadness about parting in yet another

Pragmatics is the study of meaning in context. It's about how speakers encode intent through:

1. **Conversational implicature** - suggesting something without stating it directly
2. **Cultural subtext** - unspoken cultural assumptions
3. **Indirect speech acts** - doing something with words beyond the literal action
4. **Context-dependent interpretation** - same words, different meanings

Georgian, being a high-context culture, relies heavily on pragmatics. Native speakers understand not just what is said, but what is meant through:
- Intonation
- Word choice
- Cultural knowledge
- Relationship dynamics
- Situational context

Today, you'll learn to decode these hidden layers of meaning."

### Main Content Section 1: Conversational Implicature (4:00 - 18:00)
**[Display conversation snippets with analysis]**

"Conversational implicature occurs when speakers imply something without explicitly stating it. Let's examine how this works in Georgian:

**Example 1: The Polite Refusal**

Imagine you invite someone to an event:

**A:** *გიბიძგებთ ჩემთან ჩასვლა ხვალ საღამოს?*
"Would you like to come to my place tomorrow evening?"

**B:** *შეიძლება, მგონია, მე უნდა ვიმუშაო...*
"Maybe, I think, I have to work..."

**[Show body language video]**

In Georgian culture, this isn't really about needing to work. B is politely declining without saying 'no' directly. The hedging words (*შეიძლება, მგონია*) signal uncertainty, which is often a soft no.

**Key Indicator Phrases:**

1. **არ არის გამორიცხული, მაგრამ...**
   *Ar aris gamoritskhuli, magram...*
   "It's not impossible, but..."
   *Implied meaning: "This is unlikely"*

2. **ვნახავთ**
   *Vnakhvat*
   "We'll see"
   *Implied meaning: "Probably not, but let's leave it open"*

3. **თვალში დავინახე**
   *Tvalshi davinakhe*
   "I saw it in his/her eyes"
   *Implied meaning: "I understood without words"*

**Practice Exercise 1 (12:00 - 16:00)**
**[Analyze conversation transcripts]**

"Read this conversation and identify the implied meaning:

**A:** *როგორ გაქვს ბიზნესი?*
"How is your business?"

**B:** *კარგად წავედით, ალბათ აღარაფერი...*
"We went well, probably nothing..."

**What does B really mean?**

Answer: Despite saying 'we went well,' the phrase *ალბათ აღარაფერი* ("probably nothing") suggests the business is struggling. This is a typical Georgian way of signaling problems indirectly."

---

### Main Content Section 2: Cultural Subtext and Reading Context (18:00 - 35:00)
**[Show Georgian social scenarios with analysis]**

"Georgian culture operates on shared assumptions that fluent speakers must recognize. Let's explore key areas:

**1. Hierarchical Subtext**

In Georgian, the relationship between speakers creates implicit meaning:

*ბატონო დავით, თქვენ ახლობლები ხართ?*
"Sir Davit, are you nearby?"

The use of *ბატონო* ("sir") suggests:
- Formal context
- Respectful deference
- Potential business/professional relationship

Compare with:
*დათი, ახლობლები ხარ?*
"Davit, are you nearby?"

Using first name only implies:
- Close friendship
- Casual context
- Equal status

**2. Regional and Social Class Cues**

Certain expressions carry socio-cultural markers:

**Tbilisi Urban Elite:**
*როგორ ხარ?* (Standard Georgian)

**Western Georgia:**
*რომ შეიძლება?* ("How are you?" in Gurian dialect)

**Eastern Georgia:**
*როგორ გადიხარ?* ("How do you pass?" - Khevsur idiom)

Recognizing these markers tells you about the speaker's background and helps you adjust your response.

**Practice Exercise 2 (25:00 - 30:00)**
**[Match cultural contexts with appropriate responses]**

"You're at a supra (traditional feast) and the tamada (toastmaster) says:

*დურმა, ქალბატონო...*
"'To your health, madam...'

What does this imply?

A) He wants you to drink
B) He's proposing a toast specifically directed at you
C) You need to respond with your own toast
D) All of the above

Answer: D - All of the above. The supra requires you to understand when toasting is directed at you and respond accordingly."

---

### Main Content Section 3: Indirect Speech Acts (35:00 - 50:00)
**[Demonstrate speech act theory]**

"An indirect speech act occurs when words perform an action beyond their literal meaning. In Georgian, this is particularly rich:

**Type 1: Requests Disguised as Questions**

*შეიძლება კარგი იყო დავხურო ფანჯარა?*
"Could it be good if I closed the window?"

Literally: Asking about possibility
Actually: Making a request to close the window

**Type 2: Invitations Disguised as Statements**

*ჩვენ ხვალ ვიმოქმედებთ პარკში.*
"We're going to the park tomorrow."

Literally: Stating plans
Actually: Possibly inviting you to join

**Type 3: Complaints Disguised as Observations**

*ფაქტია, ახლა ბევრად ცივია ბინა.*
"The fact is, it's quite cold in the apartment now."

Literally: Noting temperature
Actually: Implied request to turn up the heat

**Pragmatic Markers to Identify Indirect Acts:**

1. **რთულია**
   *Rtilia*
   "It's difficult"
   *Often signals: "I'd prefer not to"*

2. **შეიძლება, კარგი იყოს**
   *Sheidzleba, k'argi ik'os*
   "Maybe it would be good..."
   *Often signals: "I'm suggesting this"*

3. **ნატურალურია**
   *Nat'uraluria*
   "It's natural"
   *Often signals: "This is expected"*

**Practice Exercise 3 (42:00 - 47:00)**
**[Identify speech acts]**

"Decode this indirect speech act:

**Mother to child:**
*არ მოვიდე ეს თით ხეებზე?*
"Wouldn't this finger come to the trees?"

What is she really saying?

Answer: This is a Georgian idiom meaning 'to help clean up the garden.' She's indirectly making a request for help, not asking a literal question about trees."

---

### Main Content Section 4: Nuanced Communication Across Contexts (50:00 - 63:00)
**[Demonstrate tone and register analysis]**

"Mastering pragmatics means understanding how the same words change meaning across contexts:

**Context 1: Professional Environment**

*აუცილებელია ცვლილება.*
"It's necessary to change."

Professional context: Polite but firm directive

**Context 2: Among Friends**

*საჭიროა ცვლილება, ნახევარს.*
"Change is needed, half."

Friendly context: Casual, almost joking suggestion

**Context 3: Family Gathering**

*შეიძლება, ცვლილება არ გამოუვიდეს?*
"Couldn't a change work out?"

Family context: Very soft, indirect suggestion

**Advanced Pragmatic Particles:**

Georgian uses particle systems to encode pragmatic meaning:

1. **-ც** (enclitic -c)
   Adds emphasis, focus, or "even/also"
   *მე მიყვარს თქვენც - "I love you too"*

2. **-მც** (enclitic -mc)
   Adds "also, in addition"
   *ოთახში ყოფნამც კარგია - "Staying in the room is also good"*

3. **ვითომ**
   *Vitom*
   "As if / supposedly"
   Signals disbelief or ironic stance

4. **ანუ**
   *Anu*
   "That is / I mean"
   Signals reformulation or clarification

**Practice Exercise 4 (55:00 - 60:00)**
**[Context interpretation practice]**

"Analyze the pragmatic difference:

**A:** *ცხელია დღეს?*
"Is it hot today?"

**B (response 1):** *სწორად დაი*
"Straight forward" (idiom: "Absolutely, yes")

**B (response 2):** *სად ეტყოდა... ნელა...*
"Where would you say... slowly..."

What does each response pragmatically convey?

Answer: Response 1 shows strong agreement. Response 2 shows hesitant, skeptical agreement with implied reservation."

---

### Main Content Section 5: Decoding Non-Verbal Pragmatics (63:00 - 68:00)
**[Show video examples of body language]**

"In Georgian culture, much pragmatic meaning comes from non-verbal cues:

**Eye Contact Patterns:**
- Direct eye contact in disagreement: Shows strength and confidence
- Averted eyes with smile: Often signals politeness despite disagreement
- Extended eye contact: Can mean intimacy or challenge

**Gesture System:**
- *"მოდი"* (motion to come) with open palm: Friendly invitation
- Same gesture with one finger: Slightly commanding tone
- Head nod backward: Often means "no" (Western Georgia)

**Intonation Pragmatics:**
- Rising intonation on *რაღა?* (ragha - "what"): Surprise
- Falling intonation on same word: Annoyance or dismissal
- Extended vowel on *კაიი* (k'aii): Hesitation or skepticism

**Practice Exercise 5 (65:00 - 68:00)**
**[Watch and interpret video clips]**

**[Show Georgian conversation clips without audio]**

"What can you infer from body language?

Clip 1: Two men in Georgian traditional dress, arms crossed, strong eye contact
Likely meaning: Disagreement or respectful confrontation

Clip 2: Woman making elaborate gestures while speaking
Likely meaning: Emphasis or passion about topic

Clip 3: Elder placing hand on younger person's shoulder
Likely meaning: Guidance, blessing, or social hierarchy acknowledgment"

### Summary (68:00 - 70:00)
**[Recap key concepts]**

"Let's review what we've learned about Georgian pragmatics:

1. **Conversational implicature** - Georgians often say one thing to mean another, especially in refusals and requests
2. **Cultural subtext** - Relationship hierarchy, regional identity, and social class influence meaning
3. **Indirect speech acts** - Questions, statements, and observations often perform other functions
4. **Context is king** - The same words mean different things across professional, social, and family contexts
5. **Non-verbal pragmatics** - Body language, gesture, and intonation carry significant meaning

Remember: Mastering Georgian isn't just vocabulary and grammar. It's understanding what people truly mean in context. This takes time with native speakers and cultural immersion.

Our C1 course is now complete! You've progressed from learning the alphabet to understanding Georgian pragmatics. You're ready for real-world fluency."

---

### Assignment
**[Set up practical exercises]**

"Before moving forward, practice pragmatics:

1. **Listen actively** to at least 30 minutes of Georgian media (news, podcasts, interviews)
2. **Identify implicit meanings** - For every conversation, ask: "What are they really saying?"
3. **Practice indirect communication** - Try making requests using indirect speech acts
4. **Cultural observation** - If possible, attend Georgian social gatherings and observe pragmatic communication
5. **Keep a pragmatics journal** - Note situations where you caught cultural subtext vs when you missed it

The path forward: Continue reading Georgian literature, watching Georgian cinema, and engaging in authentic conversations. True mastery is lifelong, but you now have the tools to engage meaningfully.

Congratulations on completing the C1 level! You've mastered the grammar, vocabulary, and now pragmatics of Georgian. This is an achievement worth celebrating.

Nakhvamdis, and see you in the advanced immersion content!"
